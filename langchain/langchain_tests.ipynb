      "The Revised Psychology of Human Misjudgment, by Charlie Munger\n",
      "The Psychology of Human Misjudgment is considered the magnum opus on why we behave the way we do.\n",
      "***\n",
      "In the run-up to publishing Poor Charlies Almanack, Charlie Munger remarked that “The Psychology of Human Misjudgment” could use “a little revising” to bring it in line with his most current views on the subject.\n",
      "Charlie’s “little” revision would amount to a full-scale rewrite, with loads of new material, and a “stop-the-press” completion schedule. The talk features Charlie’s original concept of “behavioral finance,” which has now burgeoned into its own academic field of study.\n",
      "Charlie also addresses the importance of recognizing patterns to determine how humans behave, both rationally and irrationally. He shares with us his checklist of twenty-five standard causes of human misjudgment, which contains observations that are ingenious, counterintuitive, and important—values Charlie treasures in the work of other great thinkers throughout history. He also emphasizes the “lollapalooza” power of psychological misjudgments in combination.\"\n",

      "The extensive revision by Charlie in 2005, made from memory unassisted by any research, occurred because Charlie thought he could do better at age eighty-one than he did more than ten years earlier when he (1) knew less and was more harried by a crowded life and (2) was speaking from rough notes instead of revising transcripts.\n",

      "When I read transcripts of my psychology talks given about fifteen years ago, I realized that I could now create a more logical but much longer “talk,” including most of what I had earlier said.\n",
      "But I immediately saw four big disadvantages.\n",
      "First, the longer “talk,” because it was written out with more logical completeness, would be more boring and confusing to many people than any earlier talk. This would happen because I would use idiosyncratic definitions of psychological tendencies in a manner reminiscent of both psychology textbooks and Euclid. And who reads textbooks for fun or revisits Euclid?\"\n",

      "\"Second, because my formal psychological knowledge came only from skimming three psychology textbooks about fifteen years ago, I know virtually nothing about any academic psychology later developed. Yet, in a longer talk containing guesses, I would be criticizing much academic psychology. This sort of intrusion into a professional territory by an amateur would be sure to be resented by professors who would rejoice in finding my errors and might be prompted to respond to my published criticism by providing theirs. Why should I care about new criticism? Well, who likes new hostility from articulate critics with an information advantage?\"\n",

Not only would there be stylistic and substantive objections, but also there would be perceptions of arrogance in an old man who displayed much disregard for conventional wisdom while “popping-off” on a subject in which he had never taken a course. My old Harvard Law classmate, Ed Rothschild, always called such a popping-off “the shoe button complex,” named for the condition of a family friend who spoke in oracular style on all subjects after becoming dominant in the shoe button business.\n",

      "Despite these four very considerable objections, I decided to publish the much-expanded version. Thus, after many decades in which I have succeeded mostly by restricting action to jobs and methods in which I was unlikely to fail, I have now chosen a course of action in which (1) I have no significant personal benefit to gain, (2) I will surely give some pain to family members and friends, and (3) I may make myself ridiculous.

And so, before I die, I want to imitate to some extent the bequest practices of three characters: the protagonist in John Bunyan’s Pilgrim’s Progress, Benjamin Franklin, and my first employer, Ernest Buffett. Bunyan’s character, the knight wonderfully named “Old Valiant for Truth,” makes the only practical bequest available to him when he says at the end of his life: “My sword I leave to him who can wear it.” And like this man, I don’t mind if I have misappraised my sword, provided I have tried to see it correctly, or that many will not wish to try it, or that some who try to wield it may find it serves them not. Ben Franklin, to my great benefit, left behind his autobiography, his Almanacks, and much else. And Ernest Buffett did the best he could in the same mode when he left behind “How to Run a Grocery Store and a Few Things I Have Learned about Fishing.” Whether or not this last contribution to the genre was the best, I will not say.

Instead, interest in psychology was pretty well confined to a group of professors who talked and published mostly for themselves, with much natural detriment from isolation and groupthink.\n",
      "And so, right after my time at Caltech and Harvard Law School, I possessed a vast ignorance of psychology. Those institutions failed to require knowledge of the subject. And, of course, they couldn’t integrate psychology with their other subject matter when they didn’t know psychology. Also, like the Nietzsche character who was proud of his lame leg, the institutions were proud of their willful avoidance of “fuzzy” psychology and “fuzzy” psychology professors.\"\n",

By then, my craving for more theory had a long history. Partly, I had always loved theory as an aid in puzzle solving and as a means of satisfying my monkey-like curiosity. And, partly, I had found that theory-structure was a superpower in helping one get what one wanted, as I had early discovered in school wherein I had excelled without labor, guided by theory, while many others, without mastery of theory, failed despite monstrous effort. Better theory, I thought, had always worked for me and, if now available, could make me acquire capital and independence faster and better assist everything I loved.

First, I had long looked for insight by inversion in the intense manner counseled by the great algebraist, Jacobi: “Invert, always invert.” I sought good judgment mostly by collecting instances of bad judgment, then pondering ways to avoid such outcomes. Second, I became so avid a collector of instances of bad judgment that I paid no attention to boundaries between professional territories. After all, why should I search for some tiny, unimportant, hard-to-find new stupidity in my own field when some large, important, easy-to- find stupidity was just over the fence in the other fellow’s professional territory? Besides, I could already see that real-world problems didn’t neatly lie within territorial boundaries. They jumped right across. And I was dubious of any approach that, when two things were inextricably intertwined and interconnected, would try and think about one thing but not the other. I was afraid, if I tried any such restricted approach, that I would end up, in the immortal words of John L. Lewis, “with no brain at all, just a neck that had haired over.”\"\n",

It fascinated me that both the fertile female honeybee and the fertile female harvester ant could multiply their quite different normal life expectancies by exactly twenty by engaging in one gangbang in the sky. The extreme success of the ants also fascinated me—how a few behavioral algorithms caused such extreme evolutionary success grounded in extremes of cooperation within the breeding colony and, almost always, extremes of lethal hostility toward ants outside the breeding colony, even ants of the same species.\"\n",

These would not then have guided me well with respect to cults and were often written as if the authors were collecting psychology experiments as a boy collects butterflies—with a passion for more butterflies and more contact with fellow collectors and little craving for synthesis in what is already possessed. When I finally got to the psychology texts, I was reminded of the observation of Jacob Viner, the great economist, that many an academic is like the truffle hound, an animal so trained and bred for one narrow purpose that it is no good at anything else. I was also appalled by hundreds of pages of extremely nonscientific musing about comparative weights of nature and nurture in human outcomes.

And, possibly, the cause of their inadequacy was the one given by Samuel Johnson in response to a woman who inquired as to what accounted for his dictionary’s misdefinition of the word “pastern.” “Pure ignorance,” Johnson replied.

I learned this eventually, in the course of general reading, from a book, Influence, aimed at a popular audience, by a distinguished psychology professor, Robert Cialdini, at Arizona State, a very big university. Cialdini had made himself into a super-tenured “Regents’ Professor” at a very young age by devising, describing, and explaining a vast group of clever experiments in which man manipulated man to his detriment, with all of this made possible by man’s intrinsic thinking flaws.\n",

Please remember this perverse outcome when my discussion comes to incentive-caused bias as a consequence of the superpower of incentives.\n",

I also pondered considerably while craving synthesis and taking into account all my previous training and experience. The result was Munger’s partial summary of the non-patient-treating, non-nature vs. nurture- weighing parts of non-developmental psychology. This material was stolen from its various discoverers (most of whose names I did not even try to learn), often with new descriptions and titles selected to fit Munger’s notion of what makes recall easy for Munger, then revised to make Munger’s use easy as he seeks to avoid errors.\"\n",

In the ant’s case, the behavioral algorithms are few in number and almost entirely genetic in origin.

For instance, one type of ant, when it smells a pheromone given off by a dead ant’s body in the hive, immediately responds by cooperating with other ants in carrying the dead body out of the hive. And Harvard’s great E.O. Wilson performed one of the best psychology experiments ever done when he painted dead-ant pheromone on a live ant. Quite naturally, the other ants dragged this useful live ant out of the hive even though it kicked and otherwise protested throughout the entire process. Such is the brain of the ant.

He partly deserved his peak reputation because his early experiments using rats and pigeons were ingenious, and his results were both counterintuitive and important. With incentives, he could cause more behavior change, culminating in conditioned reflexes in his rats and pigeons, than he could in any other way. He made obvious the extreme stupidity, in dealing with children or employees, of rewarding behavior one didn’t want more of. Using food rewards, he even caused strong superstitions, predesigned by himself, in his pigeons. He demonstrated again and again a great recurring, generalized behavioral algorithm in nature: “Repeat behavior that works.” He also demonstrated that prompt rewards worked much better than delayed rewards in changing and maintaining behavior.

With this result, Skinner thought he had pretty well explained man’s misgambling compulsion whereunder he often foolishly proceeds to ruin. But, as we shall later see when we discuss other psychological tendencies that contribute to misgambling compulsion, he was only partly right. Later, Skinner lost most of his personal reputation (a) by overclaiming for incentive superpower to the point of thinking he could create a human utopia with it and (b) by displaying hardly any recognition of the power of the rest of psychology. He thus behaved like one of Jacob Viner’s truffle hounds as he tried to explain everything with incentive effects. Nonetheless, Skinner was right in his main idea: Incentives are superpowers. The outcome of his basic experiments will always remain in high repute in the annals of experimental science.

Most capitalist owners in a vast web of free- market economic activity are selected for ability by surviving in a brutal competition with other owners and have a strong incentive to prevent all waste in operations within their ownership. After all, they live on the difference between their competitive prices and their overall costs and their businesses will perish if costs exceed sales. Replace such owners by salaried employees of the state and you will normally get a substantial reduction in overall efficiency as each employee who replaces an owner is subject to incentive-caused bias as he determines what service he will give in exchange for his salary and how much he will yield to peer pressure from many fellow employees who do not desire his creation of any strong performance model.\"\n",

      "There is a lot of innate curiosity in mammals, but its nonhuman version is highest among apes and monkeys. Man’s curiosity, in turn, is much stronger than that of his simian relatives. In advanced human civilization, culture greatly increases the effectiveness of curiosity in advancing knowledge. For instance, Athens (including its colony, Alexandria) developed much math and science out of pure curiosity while the Romans made almost no contribution to either math or science. They instead concentrated their attention on the “practical” engineering of mines, roads, aqueducts, etc. Curiosity, enhanced by the best of modern education (which is by definition a minority part in many places), much helps man to prevent or reduce bad consequences arising from other psychological tendencies. The curious are also provided with much fun and wisdom long after formal education has ended.\n",

Sometimes, when one receives a favor, his condition is unpleasant, due to poverty, sickness, subjugation, or something else. In addition, the favor may trigger an envy-driven dislike for the person who was in so favorable a state that he could easily be a favor giver. Under such circumstances, the favor receiver, prompted partly by mere association of the favor giver with past pain, will not only dislike the man who helped him but also try to injure him. This accounts for a famous response, sometimes dubiously attributed to Henry Ford: “Why does that man hate me so? I never did anything for him.” I have a friend, whom I will now call “Glotz,” who had an amusing experience in favor-giving. Glotz owned an apartment building that he had bought because he wanted, eventually, to use the land in different development. Pending this outcome, Glotz was very lenient in collecting below-market rents from tenants.

Once owned, they suddenly become worth more to him than he would pay if they were offered for sale to him and he didn’t already own them.

A friendly broker called and offered me 300 shares of ridiculously underpriced, very thinly traded Belridge Oil at $115 per share, which I purchased using cash I had on hand. The next day, he offered me 1,500 more shares at the same price, which I declined to buy partly because I could only have made the purchase had I sold something or borrowed the required $173,000. This was a very irrational decision. I was a well-to-do man with no debt; there was no risk of loss; and similar no-risk opportunities were not likely to come along. Within two years, Belridge Oil sold out to Shell at a price of about $3,700 per share, which made me about $5.4 million poorer than I would have been had I then been psychologically acute.

My reason for suggesting an even broader definition is that many Berkshire Hathaway shareholders I know never sell or give away a single share after immense gains in market value have occurred. Some of this reaction is caused by rational calculation, and some is, no doubt, attributable to some combination of (1) reward superresponse, (2) “status quo bias” from Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency, and (3) “the endowment effect” from Excessive Self-Regard Tendency.

Their habits had been transformed, by a combination of his “Pavlovian conditioning” plus standard reward responses, into distinct and different patterns. As the waters of the flood came up and receded, many dogs reached a point where they had almost no airspace between their noses and the tops of their cages. This subjected them to maximum stress. Immediately thereafter, Pavlov noticed that many of the dogs were no longer behaving as they had. The dog that formerly had liked his trainer now disliked him, for example. This result reminds one of modern cognition reversals in which a person’s love of his parents suddenly becomes hate, as new love has been shifted suddenly to a cult. The unanticipated, extreme changes in Pavlov’s dogs would have driven any good experimental scientist into a near-frenzy of curiosity. That was indeed Pavlov’s reaction.

And so, human society is formally organized into dominance hierarchies, with their culture augmenting the natural follow-the-leader tendency of man.\n",

A fishing guide like the one I had runs the boat and gives fishing advice, establishing himself in this context as the ultimate authority figure. In the case of this guide, his native language was Spanish, while the angler’s native language was English. The angler got a big tarpon on and began submitting to many directions from this authority figure called a guide: tip up, tip down, reel in, etc. Finally, when it was necessary to put more pressure on the fish by causing more bending of the angler’s rod, the guide said in English: “Give him the rod, give him the rod.” Well, the angler threw his expensive rod at the fish, and when last seen, it was going down the Rio Colorado toward the ocean.

A honeybee normally goes out and finds nectar and then comes back and does a dance that communicates to the other bees where the nectar is. The other bees then go out and get it. Well some scientist—clever, like B. F. Skinner—decided to see how well a honeybee would do with a handicap. He put the nectar straight up. Way up. Well, in a natural setting, there is no nectar a long way straight up, and the poor honeybee doesn’t have a genetic program that is adequate to handle what she now has to communicate. You might guess that this honeybee would come back to the hive and slink into a corner, but she doesn’t. She comes into the hive and does an incoherent dance.

Before a new airliner can be sold, the government requires that it pass an evacuation test, during which a full load of passengers must get out in some short period of time. The government directs that the test be realistic. So you can’t pass by evacuating only twenty-year-old athletes. So McDonnell Douglas scheduled such a test in a darkened hangar using a lot of old people as evacuees. The passenger cabin was, say, twenty feet above the concrete floor of the hangar and was to be evacuated through moderately flimsy rubber chutes. The first test was made in the morning. There were about twenty very serious injuries, and the evacuation took so long it flunked the time test. So what did McDonnell Douglas next do?

Also pushing the company was Doubt-Avoidance Tendency with its natural drive to arrive at a decision and run with it. Then the government’s direction that the test be realistic drove Authority-Misinfluence Tendency into the mischief of causing McDonnell Douglas to overreact by using what was obviously too dangerous a test method. By now the course of action had been decided, so Inconsistency- Avoidance Tendency helped preserve the near- idiotic plan. When all the old people got to the dark hangar, with its high airline cabin and concrete floor, the situation must have made McDonnell Douglas employees very queasy, but they saw other employees and supervisors not objecting. Social-Proof Tendency, therefore, swamped the queasiness. And this allowed continued action as planned, a continuation that was aided by more Authority- Misinfluence Tendency.

In my opinion, this action was both ethical and wise under the circumstances, despite the deliberate manipulation involved. But ordinarily, when you try to use your knowledge of psychological tendencies in the artful manipulation of someone whose trust you need, you will be making both a moral and prudential error.\n",
      "The moral error is obvious. The prudential error comes because many intelligent people, targeted for conscious manipulation, are likely to figure out what you are trying to do and resent your action.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Charlie Munger revised his Psychology of Human Misjudgment talk from memory without any research. The longer version of the talk would be more logically complete but also more confusing and boring to some people due to his use of psychology textbooks and Euclid-like definitions.\n",

      " An amateur debater does not want to invite the criticism of professional academics by criticising their work without knowing the more recent developments in academic psychology. They appreciate the potential criticism that may come from the professional academics they would be debating against, due to their information advantage.\n",

      " After carefully considering the potential for disapproval, disapproval from friends and family, and the possibility of making a fool of himself, the speaker nonetheless decided to publish his much-expanded ideas, sacrificing personal benefit and the comfort of those around him for the sake of something bigger.\n",

      " The author gained interest in the standard thinking errors but during their education, psychology did not receive much approval from the mainstream and was confined to a small group of professors. As a result, the author was heavily ignorant of psychology and the institutions they studied in never required any knowledge or integration of the subject. The institutions pride themselves in avoiding the 'fuzzy' aspects of psychology and its professors.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In this talk, the speaker recounts his struggle to escape his own psychological ignorance, summarizing his ending thoughts and providing examples of psychology in action and antidotes for psychology-based issues. He ultimately asks and answers some general questions at the end. The example he uses to illustrate his initial ignorance is a long-standing Caltech course catalogue featuring a single professor listed for Abnormal Psychology and Psychoanalysis in Literature.\n",

      " When beginning his law practice, the author was aware of the influence of genetics on evolution and human behavior, that humans are \"social animals\" greatly influenced by those around them, and that they operate in limited-size dominance hierarchies, tending to respect authority and cooperate with their hierarchy while displaying distrust and dislike for outside groups.\n",
      "\n",
      " This is a story of a person's attempt to grapple with the cognitive difficulties life presented, in order to better understand it and get what they wanted. To do this, they relied on a self-help approach modeled after Ben Franklin, which was based on a theory-structure. This theory-structure was found to be a superpower in achieving goals, which was evidenced by their success in school without much effort. Desperate to acquire independence, their goal was to develop their own system of psychology to help them.\n",

He paid no attention to dividing his research among different fields because of the interconnectedness that makes those divisions useless. He ended with not wanting to be left with \"no brain at all\".\n",

      " The author was interested in learning more about destructive cults and why they were able to brainwash people and keep them in that state. Additionally, they were enthralled by the behavior of social insects such as honeybees and harvester ants, specifically their extreme success caused by their behavioral algorithms exhibiting extreme cooperation within their breeding colony and hostility to those outside.\n",
      "\n",
      " The author avoided psychology textbooks for a long time, but was disappointed when they finally read them, as the information wasn't appropriate for cults and the musings on nature vs nurture weren't scientific. The fundamental issue of the psychological effects of cults was not addressed.\n",
      "\n",
      " The authors of elementary texts on psychology chose not to analyze the complexities of psychological tendencies, likely because they did not want to overwhelm new devotees. This could be attributed to \"pure ignorance\" as suggested by Samuel Johnson. They also showed a lack of interest in discussing standard antidotes to psychological-driven folly, which was the author's particular interest.\n",

      "Robert Cialdini, a psychology professor at Arizona State University, wrote Influence, a book aimed at a popular audience. His experiments and explanations demonstrated how people could be easily manipulated due to inherent thinking errors. In response, the author sent copies of Cialdini's book to his children and gave Cialdini a share of Berkshire stock for his immense contribution to the public. Cialdini's success in selling hundreds of thousands of copies of his book was remarkable, considering that he didn't promise to improve anyone's sex life or make them money.\n",
      "\n",
      " Cialdini's book has encouraged salesmen to develop more effective methods of misleading customers, and gave Munger the motivation to combine research from three introductory psychology textbooks into a partial summary of non-patient-treating, non-nature vs. nurture- weighing parts of non-developmental psychology. Munger's synthesis was based on previous training and experience, and the material was stolen from its various discoverers.\n",

      " Social insects, with a mere 100,000 cells in their entire nervous systems, demonstrate the limitations of the evolutionary development of behavior control. Comparatively, humans have billions of cells in their brains. Ants largely follow pre-programmed responses without having much of a chance to learn; they are primarily governed by a little behavior and simple responses developed from genes.\n",
      "\n",
      " Harvard's E.O. Wilson conducted an experiment revealing the simple behavior system of ants, showing how they quickly respond to pheromones and respond to each other by carrying out tasks even though the situation may be Malfeasance. On the other hand, their limited brain may cause them to be misled and cause their demise if placed into a certain situation or manipulated by other creatures.\n",
      "\n",
      " Humans are just as liable to counterproductivity as ants, only on a much larger scale. Manipulation of humans, accidental circumstances, and \"practice evolution\" can create effects such as the quantum phenomenon in human perception, wherein, if stimulus is kept low enough, it will not get through, such as in a trick where a magician makes the Statue of Liberty disappear.\n",
      "\n",
      " A magician demonstrates how man's nervous system gives too much emphasis to differences in contrast, rather than to scientific units, by taking off a person's wristwatch without them feeling it. This is achieved by applying intense pressure elsewhere that is in stark contrast to the pressure that would be felt on the wrist, thus making the wrist pressure undetectable.\n",
      "\n",
      " Psychology professors often use a demonstration to show how easily perception and cognition can be misled by contrast. They have students place hands in hot and cold water separately and then in the same room temperature bucket; one hand believes it to be in cold water, and the other hand believes to be in hot water. This example highlights how humans are vulnerable to being manipulated and misperceived, and care should be taken to guard against this.\n",
      "\n",
      " This article discusses twelve psychological tendencies that humans have which are generally useful but may lead to errors. The article then provides antidotes to the errors and a more general discussion. The tendencies include: reward and punishment superresponse, liking/loving, disliking/hating, doubt-avoidance, inconsistency-avoidance, curiosity, Kantian fairness, envy/jealousy, reciprocation, influence-from-mere-association, simple pain-avoiding psychological denial, and excessive self-regard.\n",
      "\n",
      " This article provides an in-depth look at 25 tendencies of human psychology which have an effect on cognition and behaviour. These tendencies include the Reward and Punishment Superresponse Tendency, Excessive Self-Regard Tendency, Overoptimism Tendency, Deprival-Superreaction Tendency, and so on. It is emphasized that the power of incentives is often underestimated and the author reflects that they have learned this many times throughout their life.\n",

      " Federal Express faced difficulty motivating its night shift with traditional methods, until they tried an incentive program: paying employees for a completed shift, regardless of how long it took. This solution proved effective in quickly and efficiently accomplishing the night shift's tasks.\n",

      " Joe Wilson of the government experienced a similar confusion regarding Xerox's sales. He eventually learned that commission collection incentives pushed a lesser-quality, more expensive machine onto customers despite an inferior product. In Mark Twain's case, his cat, after being burned by a hot stove, never again opted to sit on a hot or cold stove.\n",
      "\n",
      " Ben Franklin wisely advised to appeal to interest rather than reason when attempting to persuade people, an important lesson that a house counsel for an investment bank failed to heed, costing him his job. Soviet communists also failed to recognize the power of incentives, leading to a culture of ineffective work and little reward. Probably the most important lesson of all is to ensure incentives are properly set in order to maximize success.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Harvard professor, B. F. Skinner, was renowned for his experiments using rats and pigeons and his findings that incentive systems can lead to significant behavior change in a short amount of time. Skinner was at one point the most famous psychology professor in the world due to his experiments which showed importance of timely rewards to modify and maintain behaviors. He also found that withdrawing rewards was key for maintaining conditioned reflexes.\n",
      "\n",
      " Skinner concluded that random distribution of rewards was the best way to keep reflexive behavior in place, leading him to attempt to explain misgambling compulsion. However, his fame waned due to overclaiming for incentive power and his dismissal of the rest of psychology. His contributions to experimental science remain in high praise, and his reliance on rewards has proven to be effective in helping those on the autism spectrum.\n",
      "\n",
      " The \"man-with-a-hammer\" tendency can refer to smart people like Eddie Blanchard and B.F. Skinner who become so focused on one thing that they fail to see other potential solutions outside of what they are focused on. In this talk, the speaker will address the ravages of this tendency and provide advice on how to avoid it.\n",
      "\n",
      " Incentive superpower can cause people to engage in immoral behavior in order to achieve desired outcomes, with the added defense of rationalizing such behavior. This is demonstrated by the example of Xerox salesmen who pushed customers into unfavorable purchases for the purpose of maximizing their own sales commissions.\n",

      " A surgeon in Lincoln, Nebraska sent baskets of normal gall bladders to the pathology lab. Years later, he was removed from the medical staff by a family friend who reported the surgeon believed the gall bladder was the source of all medical evil and needed to be removed as quickly as possible to help his patients.\n",
      "\n",
      " Cognitive drift is seen in every profession and every human being and can manifest as biased behavior. Skepticism should be used in taking advice from professionals, as incentives can often influence their statements. 3 steps of prevention can be used: distrust advice that is most beneficial to the advisor, learn the basics of the trade one is consulting and double check or replace much of the advice given after objective thought.\n",
      "\n",
      " Incentives have been used to cause individuals to produce terrible outcomes, as evidenced by Defense Department procurement history. In response, new laws were created to criminalize a contracting officer signing cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost contracts. Unfortunately, this remains a common reward system in many businesses, leading to potential abuses still.\n",
      "\n",
      " Cash registers are a great moral instrument because humans respond well when bad behavior is rewarded. This was well known by its creator Patterson, who overcame his own employees' thievery of his store by using the cash register.\n",
      "\n",
      " After John Patterson purchased a couple of cash registers for his store, his profits increased dramatically; he went into the cash register business, which became the successful National Cash Register Company. Patterson was a renowned do-gooder and gave his money away to charity before his passing. His cash registers revolutionized the world and was so influential that he received an epitaph similar to the great poet Horace: “I did not completely die.”\n",

      "The need to counteract employees attempting to rationalize bad behavior for rewards is an important problem. To solve this problem, Westinghouse put in place a strong system of accounting that used sound accounting theory and practice. This system was largely based on the credit experience of the subsidiary in making loans unlikely to cause losses.\n",
      "\n",
      " Westinghouse made the mistake of granting loans to real estate developers and hotels at a 95% value with highly profitable results in their accounting reports. However, this loan-making was highly risky and incorrect according to sound accounting principles, and could contribute to major losses in the future. Outside and international accountants allowed the mistake.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\" Economists have long recognized that employers often suffer from employees that prioritize themselves over their employers while employees suffer from establishments such as sweatshops or unsafe work places as a result of incentive-caused bias. Antidotes for these problems can be applied from both the employer and the employee side, such as audit systems or union pressure respectively.\n",
      "\n",
      " The Chinese emphasis on Yin and Yang is largely driven by bias in employment relations, where both employers and employees are motivated by incentives.\n",
      "\n",
      " Incentive-caused bias is a fact of life with extensive effects, such as leading to the need to make tough choices between creating sales compensation structures that keep morality in check versus greater efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      " The success of free-market capitalism is largely due to its avoidance of incentive-based bias. Its ability to select for those owners capable of succeeding in a highly competitive environment incentivizes efficiency, a trait which would not be present if salaried employees replaced owners. This lack of incentive would create a form of bias which would result in a substantial decrease in efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      " Incentive-caused bias can lead people to manipulate systems to their own benefit, so systems must be designed with 'anti-gaming' features in order to prevent this. Unfortunately many legislators and judges ignore this essential element, leading to inefficient and unfair outcomes. Education on psychological reality is important to combat this trend.\n",
      "\n",
      " Money is a major motivator of human behavior in our modern society, with many people having a habit of striving for more money even when they have no real need. It works in conjunction with other motivators such as sex, friendship, status, and companionship.\n",
      "\n",
      " \"Granny's Rule\" is an example of reward superpower that can be used by people to help control their own daily behavior. It requires people (in both business and nonbusiness aspects of their lives) to do their unpleasant but necessary tasks first, before rewarding themselves with pleasant tasks. This method is proven to be effective, and should be done daily to make the most of the reward superpower.\n",
      "\n",
      " Punishments can influence behavior, but not as flexibly as rewards, and military and naval systems often use punishments to cause extreme behavioral changes. An example of this is the European tribe that killed the last warrior to reach his assigned place and George Washington's extreme punishment of farm-boy deserters.\n",
      "\n",
      " Baby geese and humans are born with a genetic tendency to love and the greatest example of this is a mother's love for her child. In some animals, like mice, this love and liking tendency can be switched on or off by a single gene.\n",
      "\n",
      " A human's natural tendency is to like and love, not only driven by genetics, but also in external social groups. This \"Liking/ Loving Tendency\" naturally leads to seeking the admiration and approval of those not related, and can lead to the worshipping of the object of their affection. This can lead to a favoring of people and products associated with the object of their affection, as well as to them disregarding their faults and distorting facts to maintain their love.\n",
      "\n",
      " This article explores the concept of liking and loving inducing admiration, and vice versa. This feedback cycle has significant consequences, both in terms of sexual attachment, and practically in other areas of life, as exemplified by the example of Fred Buffett, who worked at a grocery store and whose hardworking nature was admired by the writer and Warren Buffett. This admiration caused the writer to change positively, suggesting liking or loving intensifies with admiration.\n",
      "\n",
      " This text explores the social policy implications associated with both extreme love and admiration, as well as hatred and dislike. It suggests that many wars throughout human history have been a result of these two forces, but clever political measures, such as elections, have proven to be an effective way of channeling and managing them.\n",
      "\n",
      " Hatred and disliking are deeply ingrained in humans and can manifest in extreme forms such as engaging in negative political campaigning and taking relatives to court. The author's father's law practice was full of intrafamily hatreds, leading the author to believe that Harvard Law School was naïve for not incorporating that into their property law teachings.\n",
      "\n",
      " Disliking and hating can affect how we perceive information, as we often ignore qualities of the object of our dislike and discredit facts and people associated with it. This can lead to extreme distortion, making it difficult to mediate between opponents. Additionally, humans are programmed to quickly remove doubt by making a decision.\n",
      "\n",
      " Animals tend to avoid doubt by quickly making decisions when faced by predatory threats, a trait that has been ingrained in humans by evolution. To ensure objectivity, humans must work to mask this tendency and must delay decision-making, an effort supported by the Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency.\n",
      "\n",
      " Man has a strong Doubt-Avoidance Tendency, which is triggered by puzzlement and stress, especially when facing religious issues. Thus, the tendency leads to most men being in some form of religion, which is what is observed in the world. This tendency is connected to other psychological tendencies such as Social-Proof Tendency and Stress-Influence Tendency.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The brain of humans naturally prefers consistency and resists change, creating habits (both good and bad) that can be hard to break. Benjamin Franklin's axiom of prevention before cure is relevant here, suggesting that being proactive is easier than attempting to nullify bad habits already formed.\n",
      "\n",
      " Evolution may have programmed the human brain to have an \"anti-change mode\" which helps preserve loyalties, reputational identity, commitments, and roles in civilization. This \"anti-change mode\" likely provided a survival advantage to our nonhuman ancestors by aiding in faster decision-making and better enabling group cooperation. Over generations, this \"anti-change mode\" would then lead to the complexities of modern life.\n",
      "\n",
      " Due to Doubt Avoidance Tendency and Inconsistency Avoidance Tendency, many cognitive errors have been made in modern times. In order to prevent bad decisions from the bias of “first conclusions”, courts require evidence and arguments from both sides before making decisions. This has been adopted as a strategy by other decision makers as well.\n",
      "\n",
      " Lord Keynes noted that people usually maintain their beliefs and attitudes, even when they are wrong, due to a mental \"shut-off device\" which restricts them from forming new, contrary ideas. Education is the process for developing the mental capacity to reconsider fixed conclusions and move past wrong thinking, which resistance to change often maintains.\n",
      "\n",
      " Max Planck, Nobel laureate and finder of Planck's constant, suggested that in all scientific disciplines, including physics, acceptance of new ideas is slow and that progress happens when a new generation comes along. This is supported by the example of Einstein, who was a great destroyer of his own ideas, but an older Einstein never accepted the full implications of quantum mechanics.\n",
      "\n",
      " Charles Darwin's success in avoiding first conclusion bias was based on his psychological insight of Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency, which enabled him to recognize our natural cognitive faults. This practice has provided many good effects in our civilizations, such as more loyalty in all roles played in life.\n",
      "\n",
      " This article relates Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency to initiation ceremonies-when a person makes big sacrifices to assume a new identity, ceremonies help intensify their commitment. However, this phenomenon can have negative outcomes-intensifying loyalty for a mafia member or a military officer to Hitler, for example.\n",
      "\n",
      " The Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency is a human trait which can be manipulated by \"manipulative compliance-practitioners\". This tendency was used by Ben Franklin to gain trust and admiration. During the Korean War, this tendency was featured as a Chinese brainwashing system, which was often more effective than torture in changing the thought process of enemy prisoners in favor of Chinese captors.\n",
      "\n",
      " Franklin's maneuver of getting approval from someone by making them treat him favorably can also work in reverse. When someone is maneuvered into hurting another person, they will tend to feel more negative emotions towards that person. This phenomenon, known as Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency, is seen in prisoner abuse that is done by guards in response to the hostility of prisoners; and this abuse spirals into worse violence if unchecked. More psychological acuity and better teaching can help mitigate prisoner abuse in the U.S. Army.\n",
      "\n",
      " Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency is a powerful force which can compel people to believe things they have only pretended to believe. This tendency often has positive effects, such as improving hypocrites, increasing objectivity in judges and jury members, and helping educational systems. But, it can also be used in a negative way in political and cult evangelism.\n",
      "\n",
      " Modern education can often have adverse effects as students are taught political ideas which they then push onto society without any evidence to back them up. This can permanently damage students, and educational institutions can be irresponsible in allowing this to happen. It is essential to avoid putting one's brain \"in chains\" before reaching one's full potential as a rational person.\n",
      "\n",
      " Human curiosity, driven by culture, is much greater than that of non-human creatures. Man's curiosity has lead to advancements in math and science, whereas the Romans focused on more practical aspects of engineering. Curiosity continues to aid man in preventing or reducing negative consequences of other tendencies, and even provides educational and wise fun after formal education has ended. Kantian fairness tendency is another psychological tendency of mankind.\n",
      "\n",
      " Immanuel Kant's “categorical imperative” is seen in modern culture, manifested through reciprocity, courtesy, and fairness, regardless of signs or signals. Strangers often share evenly in both good and bad fortune. Commonly, hostility is seen when fair-sharing is expected yet not provided.\n",
      "\n",
      " The abolition of slavery during the last three centuries was a remarkable feat, which may have been facilitated by Kantian Fairness Tendency. It may have also been influenced by the Envy/Jealousy Tendency that is a part of human nature, especially between siblings. This tendency is usually more intense in children than adults.\n",
      "\n",
      " Envy/jealousy is a widely recognized and condemned vice found in various facets of past and present societies - e.g. Jews of the civilization preceding Christ, university faculties, and modern investment banks - and frequently causes tension and disorder.

      "\n",
      " Comparing the extreme hostility Genghis Khan had towards other men to ants that display extreme hostility to their non-breeding colonies, it is evident that human and ant history suggests nature has no algorithm capable of fuelling intraspecies behaviour for species survival.

      " Wise employers oppose employees engaging in purchasing with the simplest antidotes such as prohibiting them from accepting any favors from vendors. Sam Walton endorsed this absolute prohibition policy, going as far as not allowing purchasing agents to accept a free item as small as a hot dog from a vendor. This deep understanding of the subconscious effects was demonstrated through psychological experiments, whereby people were misled by the 'compliance practitioners' through triggering the Reciprocation Tendency.\n",

After changing the request to one afternoon, the acceptance rate tripled to one in two people agreeing.\n",

      " Robert Cialdini conducted an experiment involving juvenile delinquents to demonstrate the concept of \"Reciprocation Tendency\", the idea that when one person makes a small concession it is often reciprocated with a concession from the other side. This subconscious process of reciprocation has been long overlooked by schools and universities, leading to a lesser understanding of negotiation tactics. Sam Walton, the founder of Walmart, put the concept to great use creating an empire of businesses.\n",

      " Some sellers use association by changing their product's appearance and increasing prices to suggest a higher quality product, and this is a successful method of driving up sales and profits. This applies especially with luxury goods, as buyers gain status from demonstrating good taste and affluence through higher prices.\n",
      "\n",
      " Advertisers and military bands recognize the power of mere association to influence purchasing decisions and to attract recruits. Unfortunately, people often miscalculate when connecting future successes or likings with their past experiences, leading to unwanted unintended consequences.\n",
      "\n",
      " To avoid being misled by past successes, one should carefully examine each success and associated factors closely and look for risks in any proposed new endeavor that weren't present when the past successes occurred. To illustrate this idea, the article provides examples of Napoleon and Hitler's unsuccessful invasion of Russia and the risks of continuing to gamble in a casino, or following a friend on an ill-advised venture, after positive effects were seen.\n",

      " This article discusses how we view love and the potential biases we bring to it. It also looks at other aspects of life and how our dislike of certain people often blinds us to their talents and abilities, or to a realistic assessment of a situation. The concept of the \"Persian Messenger Syndrome\" is explored as being an example of this, which is when bad news is punished unfairly by the messenger bearing it.\n",
      "\n",
      " Persian Messenger Syndrome, an old term used to describe the dangers of carrying bad news, continues to be an issue in many careers. It manifests itself in many scenarios, such as labor negotiations and legal conversations, and can even affect organizations in which significant cognition is expected, such as in the case of two major oil companies. The late CBS was infamous for this, as Chairman Paley often made bad deals due to his aggressive response to those who brought uncomfortable news.\n",
      "\n",
      " To prevent \"Persian Messenger Syndrome,\" or the withholding of bad news from leadership, it is important to create a culture that encourages bad news to be shared promptly. Berkshire Hathaway is a notable example, as they instruct employees to always share the bad news first, and that it is the good news that can wait. It is also wise to be well-informed, so people do not think they can hide news from the leadership.\n",

      " Henry Ford once said \"Why does that man hate me so? I never did anything for him,\" in response to the phenomenon of Influence-from-Mere-Association Tendency, which is when someone receiving a favor develops a dislike, and sometimes hatred, for the favor giver due to envy of their position and associations with past pain. This is illustrated by a friend of the author, Glotz, who allowed his tenants to pay below-market rent, only to be attacked by one of them at a public hearing.\n",
      "\n",
      " A tenant who was significantly behind in his rent payments became hostile and showed up to a public hearing, where he denounced the proposal of giving more money to an organization called \"Glotz\", saying he had been supported by Glotz in his college years and did not believe they needed further funding.\n",

However, it is admirable when someone is able to accept death without hope.\n",

      " Chemical dependency often leads to distorted perspectives of one's circumstances, which can lead to further deterioration. Psychoanalytic strategies have proven unsuccessful in reversing such addictions, but Alcoholics Anonymous has achieved a 50% success rate. It is important to avoid conduct that could lead to chemical dependency in order to avoid the severe damage it can cause. Excessive self-regard tendency is one of the psychological tendencies that can aid in reversing chemical dependency.\n",

      " The irrational love of self-picked numbers in lotteries and the \"endowment effect\" lead many to overvalue their own conclusions when gambling, resulting in foolish decisions. This is intensified when it comes to betting on sports, where the complexity of bets and the attachment to the sport itself can lead to addictive behaviours.\n",
      "\n",
      " People often make bad decisions by overestimating their own skill or the quality of future service they can provide, often leading to disaster. This can be seen in gambling, business decisions and hiring decisions, where employers rely too heavily on face-to-face impressions. The correct approach would be to undervalue face-to-face impressions and place more reliance on applicants' past track record.\n",

      " In this essay, the author reflects on their experience leading an academic search committee and how they applied research addressing the lack of reliability present when making decisions based on face-to-face impressions.

      " It is important to be objective when assessing oneself, family, friends, and property to avoid the folly of an excess of self-regard. There is a tendency to overestimate oneself that can sometimes lead to success, and justified pride can be a constructive force. However, it is important to not interpret the bible’s parable about the Pharisee and the Publican as a condemnation of all pride.\n",
      "\n",
      " Demosthenes, a Greek orator circa 300BC, observed that people display both a desire to avoid pain and an excess of optimism when there is no pain or threat of it. This is exemplified by people buying lottery tickets even when they are doing well, or believing that delivery-making grocery stores could displace cash-and-carry supermarkets. Trustworthy people, however, are best off in the end, but they experience inconveniences along the way.\n",

      " According to Fermat and Pascal's math, evolutionary instincts are not enough to effectively deal with risk. People react more intensely to a loss than to a gain of the same value, and this tendency - called Deprival-Superreaction Tendency - applies to both actual losses and near-misses.\n",
      "\n",
      " Man, through Deprival-Superreaction Tendency, can be irrational in assessing problems, oftentimes comparing what is close rather than what matters. An example is given of a tame dog whose act of biting its master would be triggered by the deprivation of food already in its mouth. This behavior reflects a foolish automatic tendency that is inherent in our nature.\n",
      "\n",
      " The human response to perceived loss, and resulting bureaucratic infighting, cause tremendous damage to any organization. This is why Jack Welch's reforms at General Electric were so wise and effective. He was a leader who truly understood the damage of bureaucratic conflict.\n",
      "\n",
      " Deprival-Superreaction Tendency encourages hostility and rejection of vocal nonbelievers, protecting the influence of comfortable ideological or religious views, often resulting in groupthink. It also contributes to the phenomenon of heresy, which has been used to justify much killing of heretics throughout history.\n",
      "\n",
      " The extremes of ideology maintained with intense antipathy towards non-believers often leads to cognitive dysfunction. This can be counteracted through an extreme culture of courtesy along with bringing in able and articulate disbelievers of groupthink. Derek Bok's denial of tenure appointments, while president of Harvard Law School, was a successful example of combatting groupthink.\n",
      "\n",
      " A small change to one neighbour's house was enough to create an animosity between them, demonstrating how minor grievances can lead to extreme responses. This kind of behavior is enough to drive some people away from zoning law, as one lawyer found out when he quit his role and started making golf clubs instead.\n",
      "\n",
      " Deprival-Superreaction Tendency can have dire effects in labor relations, often resulting in death or the destruction of a business. This tendency can also cause other tragedies if people are too influenced by its imperative instead of thinking rationally.\n",
      "\n",
      " Deprival-Superreaction Tendency is a powerful factor in compulsive gambling, as it leads to a passionate desire to make back losses and can be manipulated by owners of machines with multiple fruit-symbols. It also drives people to make foolish bids in open-outcry auctions, so the best way to avoid it is to simply not attend them in the first place.\n",
      "\n",
      " This form of business failure can be attributed to a combination of the Deprival-Superreaction Tendency and the Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency. The most effective solution is to learn the strategic skills of poker early on, showing that teaching does not only occur through typical academic paths.\n",

      " The narrator recounts their own experience of making a bad decision due to their Deprival-Superreaction Tendency, resulting in a significant financial loss. They bought 300 shares of Belridge Oil at an underpriced rate, but declined a second day's offer of 1,500 more shares for the same price. As a result, when Belridge Oil was sold to Shell two years later, they were $5.4 million poorer than they could've been. This story shows how ignorance of psychology can be costly.\n",
      "\n",
      " In this passage, the author argues for a broadened definition for the Deprival-Superreaction Tendency, which suggests that people do not want to risk losing potential profits, citing the reactions of Berkshire Hathaway shareholders who never sell or give away a single share. This reaction is attributed to a form of Deprival-Superreaction Tendency as well as reward superresponse, \"status quo bias\" from Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency, and \"the endowment effect\" from Excessive Self-Regard Tendency.\n",
      "\n",
      " Social-Proof Tendency is an evolutionary behavior which causes people to act how those around them do. This behavior leads to people making extraordinary, and often ridiculous decisions, as seen in experiments conducted by psychology professors. These experiments often demonstrate how people will go to great lengths to conform to those around them.\n",
      "\n",
      " Judith Rich Harris' breakthrough research demonstrated that teenagers are predisposed by genetics to value social-proof from their peers more than parents or adults. This breakthrough provides new reasons for parents to focus more on the quality of their children's peer group than on repeated exhortations. In the highest reaches of business, this phenomenon can also be found, resulting in companies making similarly foolish decisions in lockstep with each other.\n",
      "\n",
      " Oil company executives often make bad decisions triggered by doubt, due to the comfort from the actions of other oil companies. Social-Proof Tendency is more easily triggered when a person is stressed or confused, and disreputable sales organizations will often manipulate people into stressful situations to encourage them to buy. This technique is employed by religious cults as well.\n",
      "\n",
      " Social-Proof Tendency is a behavior where people follow the actions of those around them. It is important to prevent the spread of bad behaviors and encourage good behaviors in society. My father faced such a situation when he and a group from Nebraska went pheasant hunting in South Dakota and were encouraged to get a South Dakota license with a false address. He was able to prevent himself from participating.\n",

      " The Social-Proof Tendency has a perverse interaction with situations of envy and deprivation, which can cause entire civilizations to be threatened. This is seen in the Middle East where wars and nuclear threats over a small amount of land, and the resources associated with it, prevent both sides from being better off even with an arbitrary division of the land. A classic example of this phenomenon is a fight between two children who howled over a single surplus shingle while surrounded by a sea of them.\n",
      "\n",
      " Psychological tendencies have not generally been used in dispute resolution outside of domestic relations, but with the current stakes of nuclear implications, some argue for more use of psychological insight to improve future outcomes. A particular example is the Social-Proof Tendency, which would teach one to learn to ignore examples from others when they are wrong. Contrast-Misreaction Tendency is another applicable lesson that could be derived from such a package.\n",
      "\n",
      " The contrast-misreaction tendency is a psychological problem that affects the way humans process information. It can lead to making decisions which are incorrect on a small or large scale depending on the level of contrast and misreaction, resulting in wasted money or ruining lives.\n",
      "\n",
      " Real estate brokers sometimes use the Contrast-Misreaction Tendency to manipulate buyers. They show them overpriced houses and then follow up with one at a slightly lower, but still overpriced, price, triggering a sale. Even when people are aware of manipulation tactics, they may still be pressured into buying. This shows the power of psychological ploys in advertising.\n",
      "\n",
      " Small changes that have low contrast can lead to big mistakes, such as businesses dying, and Ben Franklin's aphorism that a small leak can sink a great ship emphasizes this point perfectly.

      "In later life, Nobel Prize-winning Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov became famous for his experiments on dogs, showing how behavior can be shifted due to mere-association, a phenomenon exploited by modern marketing techniques. This is commonly referred to in psychology as \"Pavlovian\" conditioning.\n",
      "\n",
      " During the Leningrad Flood of the 1920s, Pavlov noticed unexpected changes in the behavior of his dogs, such as a loss of affection for their trainer, that resembled human cognition reversals. This inspired Pavlov to investigate further, which is an admirable reaction of a scientist.\n",
      "\n",
      " Ivan Pavlov, a Russian researcher, pioneered a controversial experiment on dogs, testing their responses to stress, which resulted in many giving nervous breakdowns. His experiments showed that these could be successfully reversed in some cases, and he kept careful records. Because of his Russian background and the harshness of his experiments, he is now largely forgotten by the medical science world, with many in the field unaware of his work.\n",

      " To counter a tendency of humans to rely heavily on evidence which is easily available and \"extra- vivid,\" Darwin advocated for the weighing of evidence which is not easily accessible.

      " This passage demonstrates the Use-It-or-Lose-It Tendency, which states that skills not frequently practiced are lost and should be built to fluency for maximum retention, and the Senescence-Misinfluence Tendency, which states that cognitive abilities naturally decline with age. However, it is still possible for an individual to remain proficient in old skills and practice complex new ones until late in life.\n",

      " The author has discussed psychological tendencies, and their correlation with Euclid's system, and how \"messiness\" is unavoidable in psychology. They then asked two questions; the first being whether the psychological system is tautological compared to Euclid's, and the answer being yes. The second question was whether they could offer a real-world model to illustrate multiple psychological tendencies interacting in a diagnosable manner, to which the answer was also yes.\n",

      " McDonnell Douglas was required to pass a realistic evacuation test before selling a new airliner. They used a lot of old people as evacuees and when the first test was conducted in the morning there were many serious injuries and it failed the time test. The second test in the afternoon also failed, resulting in more serious injuries, one case of permanent paralysis.\n",
      "\n",
      " The psychological tendencies of Reward-Superresponse, Doubt-Avoidance, Authority-Misinfluence, Inconsistency-Avoidance, and Social-Proof all contributed to a disastrous situation where elderly people were put in a dark hangar with a high airline cabin and concrete floor, resulting in disaster.\n",
      "\n",
      " McDonnell Douglas had a failed morning test and suffered serious injuries. Despite strong evidence to the contrary, confirmation bias and Deprival-Superreaction Tendency led the company to maintain its original plan. This behavior is comparable to that of a gambler making a last big bet to recoup losses. This example serves to highlight the validity of using a checklist system to prevent this behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      " The psychological thought system described in the list of tendencies is beneficial despite being programmed into the human mind by evolution. It offers the potential to spread wisdom and good conduct, as well as prevent disaster. Examples are provided of how this system can be useful, such as Carl Braun's communication practices, simulators used in pilot training, and Alcoholics Anonymous.\n",
      "\n",
      " This text discusses four distinct topics: the Alcoholics Anonymous system, clinical training methods in medical schools, the rules of the U.S. Constitutional Convention, and the Harvard Business School's emphasis on decision trees. With regards to the Constitution, it is noted that the founders had to be psychologically acute to get the Constitution passed. The author also shares an anecdote of how he initially did not understand the value of the Harvard Business School curriculum, but eventually recognized the important role it plays in countering bad effects from psychological tendencies.\n",

      " Johnson & Johnson utilizes autopsy equivalents whereby past acquisitions are revisited and compared to their expected outcomes, instead of being quickly forgotten. Charles Darwin evaded confirmation bias. The Warren Buffett rule for auctions suggests to not join open-outcry auctions. All of these suggest special knowledge problems regarding thought systems.\n",
      "\n",
      " Social psychology reveals that the more people learn about a system, the less it remains true; however, this paradoxical result has its great value in driving good outcomes and preventing bad ones. Therefore, one should not be surprised by any paradox while studying psychology as it is expected like one cannot get rid of it from pure math.\n",

      " Charlie experienced a cognitive change which gave him a \"little lift in his spirits\", even though he knew he was being manipulated. This led to a discussion about the reconciliation of psychology and economics. Charlie's response to the woman's question was that he was rational, though the reader is left to judge whether this is true.\n",

      " Colin Camerer of Caltech conducted an experiment in which high-IQ students paid too much for a security because they could trade with each other in a liquid market. The author questions whether smart people can be irrational and prone to psychological influences, and whether there should be moral and prudential considerations for the knowledge of these psychological tendencies.\n",
      "\n",
      " It is possible to use psychological knowledge in a wise, ethical way like Captain Cook did to prevent scurvy; however, usually trying to manipulate others by intentionally exploiting their psychological tendencies will both be morally wrong and potentially backfire. It is also questioned whether there are factual or reasoning errors in the talk.\n",

      " An 81-year-old man, who never took courses in psychology and has read none of it in the past 15 years, successfully made a comprehensive and successful presentation on psychology after spending about 50 hours revising his material from memory. He invites others with an interest in psychology to explore further and join him in making use of inversion, driving for a complete psychological system, and especially emphasizing effects from combinations of psychological tendencies.\n",

It is suggested that greater psychological knowledge and education areneeded to identify and counteract the influence of these tendencies, and that they can either be used constructively or destructively.\n",

It also provides examples, such as Jack Welch's reforms at General Electric, Nazis's failed invasions, lotteries, chemical dependency and Frank Serpico's attempted murder, to illustrate the point.\n",

It further explores their applications in increasing wisdom and good conduct, as well as their misuse such as in the form of certain cults. It also encourages further research, careful consideration, and a checklist approach to ensure decisions are made in a wise and ethical manner.
