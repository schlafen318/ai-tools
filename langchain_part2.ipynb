      "First, the longer “talk,” because it was written out with more logical completeness, would be more boring and confusing to many people than any earlier talk. This would happen because I would use idiosyncratic definitions of psychological tendencies in a manner reminiscent of both psychology textbooks and Euclid.

      "\"Second, because my formal psychological knowledge came only from skimming three psychology textbooks about fifteen years ago, I know virtually nothing about any academic psychology later developed. Yet, in a longer talk containing guesses, I would be criticizing much academic psychology. This sort of intrusion into a professional territory by an amateur would be sure to be resented by professors who would rejoice in finding my errors and might be prompted to respond to my published criticism by providing theirs. Why should I care about new criticism? Well, who likes new hostility from articulate critics with an information advantage?\"\n",

      "\"Third, a longer version of my ideas would surely draw some disapproval from people formerly disposed to like me. Not only would there be stylistic and substantive objections, but also there would be perceptions of arrogance in an old man who displayed much disregard for conventional wisdom while “popping-off” on a subject in which he had never taken a course. My old Harvard Law classmate, Ed Rothschild, always called such a popping-off “the shoe button complex,” named for the condition of a family friend who spoke in oracular style on all subjects after becoming dominant in the shoe button business.\n",

Why am I doing this?\n",
      "One reason may be that my nature makes me incline toward diagnosing and talking about errors in conventional wisdom. And despite years of being smoothed out by the hard knocks that were inevitable for one with my attitude, I don’t believe life ever knocked all the boy’s brashness out of the man.\n",

      "My third and final reason is the strongest. I have fallen in love with my way of laying out psychology because it has been so useful for me. And so, before I die, I want to imitate to some extent the bequest practices of three characters: the protagonist in John Bunyan’s Pilgrim’s Progress, Benjamin Franklin, and my first employer, Ernest Buffett. Bunyan’s character, the knight wonderfully named “Old Valiant for Truth,” makes the only practical bequest available to him when he says at the end of his life: “My sword I leave to him who can wear it.” And like this man, I don’t mind if I have misappraised my sword, provided I have tried to see it correctly, or that many will not wish to try it, or that some who try to wield it may find it serves them not. Ben Franklin, to my great benefit, left behind his autobiography, his Almanacks, and much else. And Ernest Buffett did the best he could in the same mode when he left behind “How to Run a Grocery Store and a Few Things I Have Learned about Fishing.” Whether or not this last contribution to the genre was the best, I will not say. But I will report that I have now known four generations of Ernest Buffett’s descendants and that the results have encouraged my imitation of the founder.\"\n",

And, of course, they couldn’t integrate psychology with their other subject matter when they didn’t know psychology. Also, like the Nietzsche character who was proud of his lame leg, the institutions were proud of their willful avoidance of “fuzzy” psychology and “fuzzy” psychology professors.\"\n",

I also knew that man lived, like barnyard animals and monkeys, in limited- size dominance hierarchies, wherein he tended to respect authority and to like and cooperate with his own hierarchy members while displaying consider- able distrust and dislike for competing men not in his own hierarchy.\"\n",

I was soon surrounded by much extreme irrationality, displayed in patterns and subpatterns. So surrounded, I could see that I was not going to cope as well as I wished with life unless I could acquire a better theory-structure on which to hang my observations and experiences. By then, my craving for more theory had a long history. Partly, I had always loved theory as an aid in puzzle solving and as a means of satisfying my monkey-like curiosity. And, partly, I had found that theory-structure was a superpower in helping one get what one wanted, as I had early discovered in school wherein I had excelled without labor, guided by theory, while many others, without mastery of theory, failed despite monstrous effort. Better theory, I thought, had always worked for me and, if now available, could make me acquire capital and independence faster and better assist everything I loved. And so I slowly developed my own system of psychology, more or less in the self-help style of Ben Franklin and with the determination displayed in the refrain of the nursery story: “‘Then I’ll do it myself,’ said the little red hen.”\"\n",

First, I had long looked for insight by inversion in the intense manner counseled by the great algebraist, Jacobi: “Invert, always invert.” I sought good judgment mostly by collecting instances of bad judgment, then pondering ways to avoid such outcomes. Second, I became so avid a collector of instances of bad judgment that I paid no attention to boundaries between professional territories. After all, why should I search for some tiny, unimportant, hard-to-find new stupidity in my own field when some large, important, easy-to- find stupidity was just over the fence in the other fellow’s professional territory? Besides, I could already see that real-world problems didn’t neatly lie within territorial boundaries. They jumped right across. And I was dubious of any approach that, when two things were inextricably intertwined and interconnected, would try and think about one thing but not the other. I was afraid, if I tried any such restricted approach, that I would end up, in the immortal words of John L. Lewis, “with no brain at all, just a neck that had haired over.”\"\n",

These would not then have guided me well with respect to cults and were often written as if the authors were collecting psychology experiments as a boy collects butterflies—with a passion for more butterflies and more contact with fellow collectors and little craving for synthesis in what is already possessed. When I finally got to the psychology texts, I was reminded of the observation of Jacob Viner, the great economist, that many an academic is like the truffle hound, an animal so trained and bred for one narrow purpose that it is no good at anything else. I was also appalled by hundreds of pages of extremely nonscientific musing about comparative weights of nature and nurture in human outcomes. And I found that introductory psychology texts, by and large, didn’t deal appropriately with a fundamental issue: Psychological tendencies tend to be both numerous and inseparably intertwined, now and forever, as they interplay in life. Yet the complex parsing out of effects from intertwined tendencies was usually avoided by the writers of the elementary texts. Possibly the authors did not wish, through complexity, to repel entry of new devotees to their discipline. And, possibly, the cause of their inadequacy was the one given by Samuel Johnson in response to a woman who inquired as to what accounted for his dictionary’s misdefinition of the word “pastern.” “Pure ignorance,” Johnson replied. And, finally, the text writers showed little interest in describing standard antidotes to standard psychology-driven folly, and they thus avoided most discussion of exactly what most interested me.\"\n",

And Harvard’s great E.O. Wilson performed one of the best psychology experiments ever done when he painted dead-ant pheromone on a live ant. Quite naturally, the other ants dragged this useful live ant out of the hive even though it kicked and otherwise protested throughout the entire process. Such is the brain of the ant.

      "But there is some limit to a desirable emphasis on incentive superpower. One case of excess emphasis happened at Harvard, where B. F. Skinner, a psychology professor, finally made himself ridiculous. At one time, Skinner may have been the best-known psychology professor in the world. He partly deserved his peak reputation because his early experiments using rats and pigeons were ingenious, and his results were both counterintuitive and important. With incentives, he could cause more behavior change, culminating in conditioned reflexes in his rats and pigeons, than he could in any other way. He made obvious the extreme stupidity, in dealing with children or employees, of rewarding behavior one didn’t want more of. Using food rewards, he even caused strong superstitions, predesigned by himself, in his pigeons. He demonstrated again and again a great recurring, generalized behavioral algorithm in nature: “Repeat behavior that works.” He also demonstrated that prompt rewards worked much better than delayed rewards in changing and maintaining behavior. And, once his rats and pigeons had conditioned reflexes, caused by food rewards, he found what withdrawal pattern of rewards kept the reflexive behavior longest in place: random distribution. With this result, Skinner thought he had pretty well explained man’s misgambling compulsion whereunder he often foolishly proceeds to ruin. But, as we shall later see when we discuss other psychological tendencies that contribute to misgambling compulsion, he was only partly right. Later, Skinner lost most of his personal reputation (a) by overclaiming for incentive superpower to the point of thinking he could create a human utopia with it and (b) by displaying hardly any recognition of the power of the rest of psychology. He thus behaved like one of Jacob Viner’s truffle hounds as he tried to explain everything with incentive effects. Nonetheless, Skinner was right in his main idea: Incentives are superpowers. The outcome of his basic experiments will always remain in high repute in the annals of experimental science. And his method of monomaniacal reliance on rewards, for many decades after his death, did more good than anything else in improving autistic children.\"\n",

And so did high moral cognition. An eccentric, inveterate do-gooder (except when destroying competitors, all of which he regarded as would-be patent thieves), Patterson, like Carnegie, pretty well gave away all his money to charity before he died, always pointing out that “shrouds have no pockets.” So great was the contribution of Patterson’s cash register to civilization, and so effectively did he improve the cash register and spread its use, that in the end, he probably deserved the epitaph chosen for the Roman poet Horace: “I did not completely die.”\"\n",

Perhaps the most important of these antidotes is use of sound accounting theory and practice. This was seldom better demonstrated than at Westinghouse, which had a subsidiary that made loans having no connection to the rest of Westinghouse’s businesses. The officers of Westinghouse, perhaps influenced by envy of General Electric, wanted to expand profits from loans to outsiders. Under Westinghouse’s accounting practice, provisions for future credit losses on these loans depended largely on the past credit experience of its lending subsidiary, which mainly made loans unlikely to cause massive losses.\"\n",

      "Now there are two special classes of loans that naturally cause much trouble for lenders. The first is ninety-five percent-of-value construction loans to any kind of real estate developer, and the second is any kind of construction loan on a hotel. So, naturally, if one was willing to loan approximately ninety-five percent of the real cost to a developer constructing a hotel, the loan would bear a much-higher-than-normal interest rate because the credit- loss danger would be much higher than normal. So, sound accounting for Westinghouse in making a big, new mass of ninety-five percent-of-value construction loans to hotel developers would have been to report almost no profit, or even a loss, on each loan until, years later, the loan became clearly worth par. But Westinghouse instead plunged into big-time construction lending on hotels, using accounting that made its lending officers look good because it showed extremely high starting income from loans that were very inferior to the loans from which the company had suffered small credit losses in the past. This terrible accounting was allowed by both international and outside accountants for Westinghouse as they displayed the conduct predicted by the refrain: “Whose bread I eat, his song I sing.”\"\n",

      "In some cases, other disciplines showed more interest in psychological tendencies than did psychology, at least as explicated in psychology textbooks. For instance, economists, speaking from the employer’s point of view, have long had a name for the natural results of incentive-caused bias: “agency cost.” As the name implies, the economists have typically known that, just as grain is always lost to rats, employers always lose to employees who improperly think of themselves first. Employer- installed antidotes include tough internal audit systems and severe public punishment for identified miscreants, as well as misbehavior-preventing routines and such machines as cash registers. From the employee’s point of view, incentive-caused bias quite naturally causes opposing abuse from the employer: the sweatshop, the unsafe work place, etc. And these bad results for employees have antidotes not only in pressure from unions but also in government action, such as wage and hour laws, work-place-safety rules, measures fostering unionization, and workers’ compensation systems. Given the opposing psychology-induced strains that naturally occur in employment because of incentive-caused bias on both sides of the relationship, it is no wonder the Chinese are so much into Yin and Yang.\"\n",

Instead, the new ideas were not accepted because they were inconsistent with old ideas in place. What Keynes was reporting is that the human mind works a lot like the human egg.

To the extent the feeling of guilt has an evolutionary base, I believe the most plausible cause is the mental conflict triggered in one direction by reciprocate- favor tendency and in the opposite direction by reward superresponse tendency pushing one to enjoy one hundred percent of some good thing. Of course, human culture has often greatly boosted the genetic tendency to suffer from feelings of guilt. Most especially, religious culture has imposed hard-to-follow ethical and devotional demands on people. There is a charming Irish Catholic priest in my neighborhood who, with rough accuracy, often says, “The old Jews may have invented guilt, but we Catholics perfected it.” And if you, like me and this priest, believe that, averaged out, feelings of guilt do more good than harm, you may join in my special gratitude for reciprocate-favor tendency, no matter how unpleasant you find feelings of guilt.\"\n",

For instance, consider the case of many men who have been trained by their previous experience in life to believe that when several similar items are presented for purchase, the one with the highest price will have the highest quality. Knowing this, some seller of an ordinary industrial product will often change his product’s trade dress and raise its price significantly hoping that quality-seeking buyers will be tricked into becoming purchasers by mere association of his product and its high price. This industrial practice frequently is effective in driving up sales and even more so in driving up profits. For instance, it worked wonderfully with high-priced power tools for a long time. And it would work better yet with high-priced pumps at the bottom of oil wells. With luxury goods, the process works with a special boost because buyers who pay high prices often gain extra status from thus demonstrating both their good taste and their ability to pay.\"\n",

      "Influence-from-Mere-Association Tendency often has a shocking effect that helps swamp the normal tendency to return favor for favor. Sometimes, when one receives a favor, his condition is unpleasant, due to poverty, sickness, subjugation, or something else. In addition, the favor may trigger an envy-driven dislike for the person who was in so favorable a state that he could easily be a favor giver. Under such circumstances, the favor receiver, prompted partly by mere association of the favor giver with past pain, will not only dislike the man who helped him but also try to injure him. This accounts for a famous response, sometimes dubiously attributed to Henry Ford: “Why does that man hate me so? I never did anything for him.” I have a friend, whom I will now call “Glotz,” who had an amusing experience in favor-giving. Glotz owned an apartment building that he had bought because he wanted, eventually, to use the land in different development. Pending this outcome, Glotz was very lenient in collecting below-market rents from tenants. When, at last, there was a public hearing on Glotz’s proposal to tear down the building, one tenant who was far behind in his rent payments was particularly angry and hostile. He came to the public hearing and said, “This proposal is outrageous. Glotz doesn’t need any more money. I know this because I was supported in college by Glotz fellowships.”\"\n",

      "The second half of the “Tolstoy effect”, where the man makes excuses for his fixable poor performance, instead of providing the fix, is enormously important. Because a majority of mankind will try to get along by making way too many unreason- able excuses for fixable poor performance, it is very important to have personal and institutional antidotes limiting the ravages of such folly. On the personal level a man should try to face the two simple facts: (1) fixable but unfixed bad performance is bad character and tends to create more of itself, causing more damage to the excuse giver with each tolerated instance, and (2) in demanding places, like athletic teams and General Electric, you are almost sure to be discarded in due course if you keep giving excuses instead of behaving as you should. The main institutional antidotes to this part of the “Tolstoy effect” are (1) a fair, meritocratic, demanding culture plus personnel handling methods that build up morale and (2) severance of the worst offenders. Of course, when you can’t sever, as in the case of your own child, you must try to fix the child as best you can. I once heard of a child-teaching method so effective that the child remembered the learning experience over fifty years later. The child later became Dean of the USC School of Music and then related to me what his father said when he saw his child taking candy from the stock of his employer with the excuse that he intended to replace it later.

      "What happened to cause Pavlov’s last work was especially interesting. During the great Leningrad Flood of the 1920s, Pavlov had many dogs in cages. Their habits had been transformed, by a combination of his “Pavlovian conditioning” plus standard reward responses, into distinct and different patterns. As the waters of the flood came up and receded, many dogs reached a point where they had almost no airspace between their noses and the tops of their cages. This subjected them to maximum stress. Immediately thereafter, Pavlov noticed that many of the dogs were no longer behaving as they had. The dog that formerly had liked his trainer now disliked him, for example. This result reminds one of modern cognition reversals in which a person’s love of his parents suddenly becomes hate, as new love has been shifted suddenly to a cult. The unanticipated, extreme changes in Pavlov’s dogs would have driven any good experimental scientist into a near-frenzy of curiosity. That was indeed Pavlov’s reaction.

Well, in a natural setting, there is no nectar a long way straight up, and the poor honeybee doesn’t have a genetic program that is adequate to handle what she now has to communicate.

      "\"This tendency was not in any of the psychology texts I once examined, at least in any coherent fashion, yet it dominates life. It accounts for the extreme result in the Milgram experiment and the extreme success of some cults that have stumbled through practice evolution into bringing pressure from many psychological tendencies to bear at the same time on conversion targets. The targets vary in susceptibility, like the dogs Pavlov worked with in his old age, but some of the minds that are targeted simply snap into zombiedom under cult pressure. Indeed, that is one cult’s name for the conversion phenomenon: snapping.\"\n",

How could anyone who had taken a freshman course in physics or chemistry not be driven to consider, above all, how psychological tendencies combine and with what effects? Why would anyone think his study of psychology was adequate without his having endured the complexity involved in dealing with intertwined psychological tendencies?

      "I will make a few tentative suggestions. Maybe many of the long-dead professors wanted to create a whole science from one narrow type of repeat- able psychology experiment that was conductible in a university setting and that aimed at one psychological tendency at a time. If so, these early psychology professors made a massive error in so restricting their approach to their subject. It would be like physics ignoring (1) astrophysics because it couldn’t happen in a physics lab, plus (2) all compound effects. What psychological tendencies could account for early psychology professors adopting an over-restricted approach to their own subject matter? One candidate would be Avail- ability-Misweighing Tendency grounded in a preference for easy-to-control data. And then the restrictions would eventually create an extreme case of man with a hammer tendency. Another candidate might be envy/jealousy Tendency through which early psychology professors displayed some weird form of envy of a physics that was misunderstood. And this possibility tends to demonstrate that leaving envy/jealousy out of academic psychology was never a good idea.\"\n",

      "My first is a compound question: Isn’t this list of psychological tendencies tautological to some extent compared to the system of Euclid? That is, aren’t there overlaps in the tendencies? And couldn’t the system be laid out just as plausibly in a somewhat different way?\n",
      "The answers are yes, yes, and yes, but this matters only moderately. Further refinement of these tendencies, while desirable, has a limited practical potential because a significant amount of messiness is unfixable in a soft science like psychology.\n",
      "My second question is: Can you supply a real- world model, instead of a Milgram-type controlled psychology experiment, that uses your system to illustrate multiple psychological tendencies interacting in a plausibly diagnosable way?\"\n",

      "\"The answer is yes. One of my favorite cases involves the McDonnell Douglas airliner evacuation test. Before a new airliner can be sold, the government requires that it pass an evacuation test, during which a full load of passengers must get out in some short period of time. The government directs that the test be realistic. So you can’t pass by evacuating only twenty-year-old athletes. So McDonnell Douglas scheduled such a test in a darkened hangar using a lot of old people as evacuees. The passenger cabin was, say, twenty feet above the concrete floor of the hangar and was to be evacuated through moderately flimsy rubber chutes. The first test was made in the morning. There were about twenty very serious injuries, and the evacuation took so long it flunked the time test. So what did McDonnell Douglas next do? It repeated the test in the afternoon, and this time there was another failure, with about twenty more serious injuries, including one case of permanent paralysis.\"\n",

      "What psychological tendencies contributed to this terrible result? Well, using my tendency list as a checklist, I come up with the following explanation. Reward-Superresponse Tendency drove McDonnell Douglas to act fast. It couldn’t sell its airliner until it passed the test. Also pushing the company was Doubt-Avoidance Tendency with its natural drive to arrive at a decision and run with it. Then the government’s direction that the test be realistic drove Authority-Misinfluence Tendency into the mischief of causing McDonnell Douglas to overreact by using what was obviously too dangerous a test method. By now the course of action had been decided, so Inconsistency- Avoidance Tendency helped preserve the near- idiotic plan. When all the old people got to the dark hangar, with its high airline cabin and concrete floor, the situation must have made McDonnell Douglas employees very queasy, but they saw other employees and supervisors not objecting. Social-Proof Tendency, therefore, swamped the queasiness. And this allowed continued action as planned, a continuation that was aided by more Authority- Misinfluence Tendency. Then came the disaster of the morning test with its failure, plus serious injuries. McDonnell Douglas ignored the strong disconfirming evidence from the failure of the first test because confirmation bias, aided by the trig- gering of strong Deprival-Superreaction Tendency, favored maintaining the original plan. McDonnell Douglas’ Deprival-Superreaction Tendency was now like that which causes a gambler, bent on getting even after a huge loss, to make his final big bet. After all, McDonnell Douglas was going to lose a lot if it didn’t pass its test as scheduled. More psychology-based explanation can probably be made, but the foregoing discussion is complete enough to demonstrate the utility of my system when used in a checklist mode.\"\n",

Colin Camerer of Caltech, who works in “experimental economics,” devised an interesting experiment in which he caused high I.Q. students, playing for real money, to pay price A+B for a “security” they knew would turn into A dollars at the end of the day. This foolish action occurred because the students were allowed to trade with each other in a liquid market for the security. And some students then paid price A+B because they hoped to unload on other students at a higher price before the day was over. What I will now confidently predict is that, despite Camerer’s experimental outcome, most economics and corporate finance professors who still believe in the “hard-form efficient market hypothesis” will retain their original belief. If so, this will be one more indication of how irrational smart people can be when influenced by psychological tendencies.\"\n",

      "\" Charlie Munger, in the run-up to publishing Poor Charlie's Almanack, revised his magnum opus on why we behave the way we do, titled \"The Psychology of Human Misjudgment\". This revision included loads of new material and a \"stop-the-press\" completion schedule. The talk features Charlie's original concept of \"behavioral finance\", which has now become its own academic field of study.\n",
      "\n",
      " Charlie Munger discusses the importance of recognizing patterns to understand human behavior, and shares his checklist of 25 standard causes of human misjudgment. He emphasizes the \"lollapalooza\" power of psychological misjudgments in combination, and this talk is available in printable PDF form.\n",
      "\n",
      " Charlie revised his psychology talks from memory without any research in 2005, believing he could do better than he did more than ten years earlier. He saw four disadvantages to the longer, more logical talk he was creating, as it would be more boring and confusing than his earlier talks. He would use definitions of psychological tendencies in a manner similar to psychology textbooks and Euclid.\n",
      "\n",
      " The speaker is concerned about the potential for criticism from professional psychologists if they were to read his published guesses about psychology, as he has not kept up with the academic developments in the field. He is worried about the potential hostility from those with an information advantage, and is asking why he should care about this new criticism.\n",
      "\n",
      " The author is concerned that if he expresses his ideas in a longer form, he will be met with disapproval due to his disregard for conventional wisdom and his lack of formal education on the subject. His Harvard Law classmate Ed Rothschild referred to this as the \"shoe button complex,\" which is a term for someone who speaks authoritatively on a subject they are not an expert in. The author is worried that he may make a fool of himself.\n",
      "\n",
      " Despite four major objections, the author decided to publish a much-expanded version of their work. The author's decision was motivated by their inclination to diagnose and talk about errors in conventional wisdom, as well as their approval of Diogenes' attitude of not trying to please everyone.\n",
      "\n",
      " The author wants to imitate the bequest practices of three characters: the protagonist in John Bunyan’s Pilgrim’s Progress, Benjamin Franklin, and their first employer, Ernest Buffett. The author has been inspired by the legacy left behind by these three characters and wants to leave something behind for future generations.\n",
      "\n",
      " The author was educated in an era where psychology was not widely accepted, and as a result, he was largely ignorant of the subject. He notes that the institutions he attended, Caltech and Harvard Law School, did not require knowledge of psychology and were proud of their avoidance of the subject.\n",
      "\n",
      " This talk is about the speaker's journey to gain knowledge and understanding of psychology, and how it can be applied to everyday life. It will include examples of psychology in action, and how to combat psychological dysfunction. The speaker will end by asking and answering some general questions about their journey.\n",
      "\n",
      " The author had a respect for the power of genetic evolution and an appreciation of man's similarities to other animals and insects. He was aware that man is a social animal, influenced by the behavior of those around him, and that he lives in a limited-size dominance hierarchy, where he tends to respect authority and cooperate with his own hierarchy members while displaying distrust and dislike for those outside of his hierarchy.\n",
      "\n",
      " The author was surrounded by irrationality and realized they needed a better theory-structure to cope with life. They had always been drawn to theory and found it to be a superpower in helping them get what they wanted. As a result, they developed their own system of psychology, inspired by Ben Franklin and the determination of the little red hen.\n",
      "\n",
      " The author used two approaches to gain insight: inverting the problem and collecting instances of bad judgment, regardless of professional boundaries. He was wary of approaches that only considered one part of a problem, as he feared it would lead to a lack of understanding.\n",
      "\n",
      " The author was curious about how and why destructive cults were able to brainwash people and keep them in that state, and also about the success of social insects, such as honeybees and harvester ants, which can multiply their life expectancies by engaging in one gangbang in the sky. The author resolved to find an answer to these questions through general reading and musing.\n",
      "\n",
      " The author avoided psychology textbooks until midlife, and when they finally read them, they were disappointed by the lack of scientific rigor and the avoidance of complex topics. They were also dismayed by the lack of discussion of antidotes to psychology-driven folly.\n",
      "\n",
      " Robert Cialdini, a psychology professor at Arizona State University, wrote a book called Influence which explains how people can be manipulated due to their intrinsic thinking flaws. The book was a success, selling hundreds of thousands of copies, and the author was rewarded with a share of Berkshire stock.\n",
      "\n",
      " Cialdini's book was bought by many people who wanted to learn how to avoid being tricked by salesmen, but it was also bought by salesmen who wanted to learn how to be more effective in misleading customers. This is an example of incentive-caused bias, which is a consequence of the power of incentives.\n",
      "\n",
      " Munger created a summary of non-patient-treating, non-nature vs. nurture-weighing parts of non-developmental psychology, using material from various sources and revising it to make it easier to recall and use.\n",
      "\n",
      " This article discusses the limitations of evolution in the development of the nervous-system cells that control behavior, as demonstrated by social insects such as ants. These insects have a mere 100,000 or so cells in their entire nervous systems, compared to man’s multiple billions of cells in his brain alone. Ants are composed of a living physical structure plus behavioral algorithms in its nerve cells, which are few in number and almost entirely genetic in origin. The ant learns a little behavior from experiences, but mostly it merely responds to stimuli with a few simple responses programmed into its nervous system by its genes.\n",
      "\n",
      " E.O. Wilson conducted an experiment in which he painted a live ant with the pheromone of a dead ant, and the other ants responded by dragging the live ant out of the hive despite its protests. This demonstrates the limitations of the ant's simple behavior system, which relies on a limited repertoire of responses that are not always appropriate.\n",
      "\n",
      " This article discusses how the limited brain of ants can be misled by circumstances and manipulation from other creatures. It also suggests that the human brain can operate counterproductively in a similar way due to oversimplicity in its mental process, even when trying to solve more complex problems than those faced by ants.\n",
      "\n",
      " Man's perception system is easily fooled, either by manipulation or by quantum effects. In this example, a magician was able to make the Statue of Liberty disappear by slowly rotating the audience's platform below the sensory threshold, and then opening a curtain in the place where the Statue had been.\n",
      "\n",
      " A magician can remove a person's wristwatch without them feeling it by applying intense pressure of touch on other parts of the body, creating a high contrast that takes the pressure on the wrist below perception. This demonstrates how our perception can be misweighted due to the shock of contrast.\n",
      "\n",
      " Psychology professors use a demonstration involving buckets of hot and cold water to illustrate how perception can be easily fooled by contrast. This same phenomenon can be seen in everyday life, and can lead to being fooled by magicians or other manipulators if one does not take precautions against the wrong effects of perception and cognition.\n",
      "\n",
      " This article discusses six psychological tendencies that are generally useful but can lead to errors. These tendencies are the Reward and Punishment Superresponse Tendency, the Liking/Loving Tendency, the Disliking/Hating Tendency, the Doubt-Avoidance Tendency, the Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency, and the Curiosity Tendency. The article will discuss errors from each tendency and provide antidotes to them.\n",
      "\n",
      " This article discusses 24 psychological tendencies that influence human behavior, including doubt-avoidance, inconsistency-avoidance, curiosity, Kantian fairness, envy/jealousy, reciprocation, influence-from-mere-association, pain-avoiding psychological denial, excessive self-regard, overoptimism, deprival-superreaction, social-proof, contrast-misreaction, stress-influence, availability-misweighing, use-it-or-lose-it, drug-misinfluence, senescence-misinfluence, authority-misinfluence, twaddle, reason-respecting, and lollapalooza tendencies. These tendencies all contribute to the reward and punishment superresponse tendency.\n",
      "\n",
      " This article discusses the power of incentives and disincentives in changing cognition and behavior, and how even those who think they understand the power of incentives often underestimate it.

      " B.F. Skinner was a psychology professor at Harvard who was renowned for his experiments using rats and pigeons to demonstrate the power of incentives. He showed that prompt rewards were more effective than delayed rewards in changing and maintaining behavior, and that random distribution of rewards kept reflexive behavior in place the longest. However, he overclaimed the power of incentives and lost his reputation, failing to recognize the power of the rest of psychology. Despite this, his experiments remain highly regarded and his method of using rewards has been beneficial in improving autistic children.\n",

      " Harvard Law School professors used to joke about a Yale professor who was overly focused on declaratory judgments, which was similar to Skinner's extreme emphasis on incentive superpower. This \"man-with-a-hammer tendency\" can ruin the reputation of even the most brilliant people, but there are antidotes that can reduce its effects.\n",
      "\n",
      " Incentive superpower can lead to incentive-caused bias, where people drift into immoral behavior in order to get what they want, and then rationalize their bad behavior. An example of this is the salesmen at Xerox who harmed customers in order to maximize their sales commissions.\n",

      " Cognitive drift, or incentive-caused bias, is present in every profession and can lead to terrible behavior. Professional advice should be taken with a grain of salt, and one should double check, disbelieve, or replace it with objective thought. To protect oneself, one should fear advice that is especially beneficial to the advisor, learn the basics of the advisor's trade, and double check the advice.\n",

      " Incentive-caused bias is a major issue with important solutions, yet it is not often discussed in psychology courses. This is because it is not easily demonstrated in academic experiments, and so is often overlooked by psychologists. However, it is a prominent issue in literature and is addressed in standard business routines.\n",
      "\n",
      " Economists have long recognized the effects of incentive-caused bias in the employer-employee relationship, leading to employer-installed antidotes and employee-led pressure from unions and government action. This psychology-induced strain in employment is reflected in the Chinese concept of Yin and Yang.\n",
      "\n",
      " Incentive-caused bias is unavoidable and has wide-reaching implications. For example, a sales force that is solely reliant on commissions may be more efficient but less moral than one with a different compensation arrangement. As a result, difficult decisions must be made when creating a sales force's compensation structure.\n",
      "\n",
      " Free-market capitalism has been successful due to its prevention of incentive-caused bias. Owners in this system are selected for their ability to survive in competition and have an incentive to prevent waste. If state employees replace owners, there is a reduction in efficiency due to incentive-caused bias and peer pressure.\n",
      "\n",
      " People often use their ingenuity to game systems for their own benefit, so anti-gaming features are necessary in system design. Additionally, people should be rewarded for what cannot be faked, but this is often ignored by legislators and judges, leading to a deterioration of behavior and efficiency, as well as unfair costs and wealth transfers. If education was improved, better system design could come out of legislatures and courts.\n",
      "\n",
      " Money is the main reward that drives human behavior, as it is exchangeable for many desired things and can be used to gain status. Money is a major factor in modern civilization, and is often intertwined with other forms of reward. People use money to buy status and use status to get money, or do both at the same time.\n",
      "\n",
      " Money is not the only reward that can motivate people; other nonmonetary items such as sex, friendship, companionship, and status can also be effective in changing behavior and cognition.\n",

      " \"Granny's Rule\" is a reward superpower that can be used to manipulate behavior, even when using items already possessed. It requires that unpleasant tasks be done first before rewarding oneself with pleasant tasks. This practice is wise and sound, and is best used on a daily basis for maximum effect.\n",
      "\n",
      " Punishments can influence behavior and cognition, although not as effectively as rewards. For example, when prominent business executives were sent to prison for price-fixing, the behavior was greatly reduced. Military and naval organizations have often used extreme punishments to cause extreme behavior, such as a European tribe that killed the last warrior to reach his assigned place. George Washington also used extreme punishments, such as hanging farm-boy deserters forty feet high, to deter others from desertion.\n",

      " Baby geese and humans are born with an innate tendency to love and follow the first creature that is nice to them, usually their mother. This tendency is triggered by a gene in both humans and mice, though the gene can be deleted in mice. This suggests that the same gene is present in mother mice and goslings.\n",
      "\n",
      " Humans have evolved to form strong social bonds beyond their family, and to seek out the affection and approval of many people not related to them. This is evidenced by the current extremes of romantic love, which did not occur in the distant past, and by the courtship competitions won by those displaying exceptional devotion.\n",
      "\n",
      " The Liking/Loving Tendency acts as a conditioning device that causes people to ignore faults, comply with wishes, and favor people, products, and actions associated with the object of their affection. Admiration also causes or intensifies liking or love, which can lead to extreme consequences, including self-destruction.\n",

      " War has been a part of human history since the beginning, and even with the spread of religion and advanced civilization, it remains a savage act. Political arrangements have been created to channel hatreds and dislikings into nonlethal patterns, but these feelings never go away completely. This is evidenced by the maxim \"Politics is the art of marshalling hatreds\" and the popularity of negative political advertising in the United States.\n",
      "\n",
      " Warren Buffett has observed that wealthy people can afford to sue their relatives, and this is often seen in family dynamics. The author's father's law practice in Omaha was full of such cases. When the author attended Harvard Law School, he noticed that the property law classes did not address sibling rivalry in the family business, leading him to believe that the school was unrealistic and wore \"blinders\" like the horses of yore. He believes that sibling rivalry has not yet been incorporated into property law as taught at Harvard.\n",
      "\n",
      " Disliking/Hating Tendency is a conditioning device that causes people to ignore virtues in the object of their dislike, dislike people, products, and actions associated with the object, and distort facts to facilitate hatred. This distortion can be so extreme that it leads to miscognition. Doubt Avoidance Tendency is another programming of the brain that causes people to quickly reach a decision to remove doubt.\n",
      "\n",
      " Evolution has caused humans to have a tendency to quickly remove doubt by reaching a decision, which is beneficial for prey animals threatened by predators. This tendency is so strong that judges and jurors must wear a \"mask\" of objectivity to counter it and help ensure real objectivity.\n",
      "\n",
      " Man has a Doubt-Avoidance Tendency which is triggered by puzzlement and stress, leading to a natural state of being in some form of religion. This tendency is likely responsible for the inconsistent faiths of others, and is a big part of the answer to why people have faith.\n",
      "\n",
      " Human brains are reluctant to change, leading to the formation of habits, both good and bad, that can become destiny. This is illustrated by the quote from Marley's ghost in Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol, who speaks of the chains of habit he forged in life that were too light to be felt before they became too strong to be broken.\n",
      "\n",
      " Franklin's Poor Richard's Almanack states that it is easier to prevent a habit than to change it, and this is due to the Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency of the brain. This tendency also maintains one's previous conclusions, loyalties, identity, commitments, and roles in a civilization. It is believed that this anti-change mode was caused by a combination of factors.\n",

      " Doubt-Avoidance Tendency, which is a mental habit formed early in life, is a cognitive error that has been passed down from our nonhuman ancestors. This tendency to quickly reach a conclusion and resist any change in that conclusion has been beneficial in the past, but in modern life it can lead to errors in cognition.\n",
      "\n",
      " Courts have adopted strategies to combat the bad-decision problem caused by Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency, such as requiring judges and juries to hear evidence and argument from both sides before making decisions. This helps prevent bad thinking from \"first conclusion bias.\" Other modern decision makers also often require groups to consider counterarguments before making decisions.\n",
      "\n",
      " Lord Keynes observed that people tend to cling to their existing beliefs and attitudes, even when presented with evidence that they are wrong. This is similar to the way a human egg has an automatic shut-off device that prevents other sperm from entering. Education is an exercise in developing the wisdom to recognize and reject wrong thinking.\n",
      "\n",
      " Max Planck, Nobel laureate and discoverer of Planck's constant, noted that even in hard science departments, old ideas are often held onto, and progress is made by a new generation that is less brain-blocked by previous conclusions. This was seen in Einstein, who was a great destroyer of his own ideas but never accepted the full implications of quantum mechanics.\n",
      "\n",
      " Charles Darwin was a successful user of an antidote to first conclusion bias, which is now known as confirmation bias. He recognized man's natural cognitive faults arising from Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency and used this insight to advance his work. Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency has many positive effects in civilization, such as people being more loyal in their roles in life.\n",
      "\n",
      " Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency states that when a person makes a large sacrifice to assume a new identity, they will become more devoted to it. To reinforce this, civilization has created tough initiation ceremonies to intensify the commitment. Unfortunately, this can also be used to intensify bad conduct, such as the loyalty of a mafia member or a military officer making a blood oath of loyalty to Hitler.\n",
      "\n",
      " Ben Franklin's technique of gaining approval and trust by asking for small favors was used by the Chinese during the Korean War as a form of brainwashing. This technique was often more effective than torture in altering prisoner cognition in favor of the Chinese captors.\n",
      "\n",
      " The Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency explains why people tend to reciprocate hostility, leading to prisoner abuse by guards. To prevent and stop this abuse, the U.S. Army should make an effort to increase psychological acuity and teaching on the subject.\n",
      "\n",
      " The Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency is so strong that it can cause people to come to believe something they initially only pretended to believe. Examples of this include actors believing they are the characters they portray, hypocrites becoming more virtuous, judges and jurors becoming more objective, and lawyers and advocates believing what they initially only pretended to believe.\n",
      "\n",
      " Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency, with its \"status quo bias,\" can be beneficial in clinical medical education, as it forces the learner to \"see one, do one, and then teach one,\" thus pounding the learning into the teacher. However, this power of teaching to influence the cognition of the teacher can have negative consequences when it is used in political and cult evangelism.\n",

      " Modern education can do more harm than good when students are taught and encouraged to push political notions onto others. This can lead to students permanently damaging their own mental habits and potential as rational people. Educational institutions that create this climate are irresponsible and should be avoided.\n",

      " Immanuel Kant's \"categorical imperative\" is a \"golden rule\" that encourages humans to act in a way that benefits everyone.

      " This article discusses the Kantian Fairness Tendency, which is believed to have contributed to the abolition of slavery in the last three centuries, and the Envy/Jealousy Tendency, which is believed to have evolved from the need for food. It also discusses how strangers often share in both good and bad fortune, and the hostility that can arise when fair-sharing is expected but not provided.\n",
      "\n",
      " Sibling jealousy is a strong emotion, often greater than jealousy towards strangers, and is seen in many forms of literature, religion, and myth. It is so powerful that it was forbidden in the laws of Moses and warned against by the Prophet. Kantian Fairness Tendency likely contributes to this result.\n",
      "\n",
      " Envy and jealousy are rampant in modern life, especially in university communities and investment banks. To prevent disorder, many law firms have adopted a policy of equal compensation for all senior partners, regardless of their contributions. Warren Buffett has observed that it is not greed, but envy that drives the world.\n",
      "\n",
      " Despite the prevalence of envy and jealousy in everyday life, there is a general taboo against discussing it openly. This is evidenced by the lack of coverage of envy/jealousy in psychology textbooks and the absence of any large group discussions that identify envy/jealousy as the cause of someone's argument. The article seeks to explain why this taboo exists.\n",
      "\n",
      " This article discusses the taboo of labeling a position as envy/jealousy-driven and argues that this taboo should not extend to psychology texts, as the reciprocation tendency of humans is an important factor in group cooperation. This tendency is also seen in other animals, such as apes, monkeys, and dogs.\n",
      "\n",
      " In some wars, the tendency to reciprocate disfavors has caused extreme hatred and brutal conduct, leading to a situation where no prisoners were taken and the only acceptable enemy was a dead one. In the case of Genghis Khan, even this was not enough, as he demanded that corpses be hacked into pieces.\n",
      "\n",
      " This mental exercise compares Genghis Khan's extreme hostility towards other men to the extreme hostility of ants towards members of their own species. It suggests that nature does not have a general algorithm for intraspecies behavior that would ensure species survival, and that turn-the-other-cheek behavior may not be the best idea for a country when dealing with outsiders. It also suggests that culture will have to do a lot of heavy lifting to make up for the lack of help from genes.\n",
      "\n",
      " This article discusses the intensity of reciprocated hostility in peacetime and wartime, and suggests that the antidote to overactive hostility is to train oneself to defer reaction.

      " Reciprocate-favor tendency is a subconscious force that can be used by some people to mislead others. An example of this is when an automobile salesman gives a customer a cup of coffee in order to get them to part with an extra five hundred dollars. This is a common tactic used by salespeople, and it can be difficult to protect oneself from it.\n",
      "\n",
      " Purchasing agents of a rich employer are more likely to accept favors from vendors, which can lead to extra costs. Employers should oppose this tendency by prohibiting their agents from accepting any favors from vendors. Sam Walton's policy of not allowing his agents to accept even a hot dog from a vendor is an effective way to prevent this.\n",
      "\n",
      " In a famous psychology experiment, Cialdini demonstrated the power of \"compliance practitioners\" to mislead people by triggering their subconscious Reciprocation Tendency. When asking strangers to supervise juvenile delinquents on a trip to a zoo, Cialdini got a one-in-six acceptance rate. When he changed his request to a two-year commitment, he got a one hundred percent rejection rate. However, when he followed up with a request to spend one afternoon taking juvenile delinquents to a zoo, the acceptance rate tripled.\n",
      "\n",
      " Robert Cialdini conducted an experiment in which his \"compliance practitioners\" made a small concession, which was reciprocated by a small concession from the other side. This resulted in a much higher percentage of the experimental subjects agreeing to an irrational request. Cialdini's experiment was widely recognized and taught in many universities, demonstrating the importance of his work.\n",
      "\n",
      " Reciprocation Tendency is an important concept that has been overlooked by law schools for decades, leading to educational malpractice. This concept was well-known to Sam Walton, and is essential for law students to understand when representing clients in negotiations.\n",
      "\n",
      " Cialdini's explanation of the Watergate burglary reveals the power of the Reciprocation Tendency, which can lead to extreme and dangerous consequences. This tendency was a major factor in the resignation of the United States president in the Watergate scandal.\n",
      "\n",
      " Reciprocity-based religious beliefs have had both positive and negative effects throughout history. Examples of the negative include the ritualized murder of the Phoenicians and Aztecs, and the Romans' return to human sacrifice during the Punic Wars. On the other hand, the idea of obtaining help from God in exchange for good behavior has likely been very beneficial.\n",
      "\n",
      " Reciprocation Tendency has a positive effect on human life, often being used to counter or prevent bad results from other psychological tendencies. It is also seen in relationships of affection, where parties are more interested in pleasing than being pleased.\n",
      "\n",
      " Reciprocate-favor tendency can lead to feelings of guilt, which can be amplified by religious culture. Despite this, feelings of guilt can do more good than harm, and reciprocate-favor tendency should be appreciated for its positive effects.\n",

      " A person's behavior can be conditioned by rewards they receive from a product, such as a can of branded shoe polish. If they have a good experience with it, they are likely to buy the same product again when they need it.\n",
      "\n",
      " This article discusses the practice of raising prices of ordinary industrial products and changing their trade dress in order to trick quality-seeking buyers into purchasing them. This practice is effective in driving up sales and profits, especially with luxury goods, as buyers gain extra status from demonstrating their good taste and ability to pay.\n",
      "\n",
      " Advertisers use the power of association to influence consumer decisions, such as using a pretty girl in a shoe polish ad. Military bands also use association to attract and retain soldiers. However, the most damaging miscalculations from association do not usually come from advertisers or music providers.\n",
      "\n",
      " People often make miscalculations due to their past successes, likes, and dislikes, including a natural aversion to bad news. To avoid being misled, one should remember the example of Napoleon and Hitler, who both experienced disastrous results after invading Russia despite their prior successes. This same phenomenon can be seen in everyday life, such as when a person gambles in a casino and wins, or when a person invests in a venture headed by an untalented friend. In both cases, the person is likely to repeat the same action with disastrous results.\n",
      "\n",
      " The proper antidotes to being misled by past successes are to examine each success for non-causative factors and to look for dangerous aspects of a new undertaking that were not present in the past. This was demonstrated by a famous court case in which an otherwise admirable woman gave obviously false testimony due to her husband's influence.\n",
      "\n",
      " The jury in this case recognized the strong influence of love on the woman's cognition, and this is a common occurrence in society today. People disagree on how much blindness should accompany love, but it is suggested that one should \"see it like it is and love anyway\". Hating and disliking can also cause miscalculation, which is often disguised on a subconscious basis.\n",
      "\n",
      " The \"Persian Messenger Syndrome\" is an example of the negative consequences of associating a person with an unfavorable outcome. Ancient Persians would kill messengers who brought bad news, leading them to instead run away and hide rather than do their job.\n",
      "\n",
      " Persian Messenger Syndrome is still present in modern life, although in less lethal forms. It is dangerous to be a carrier of unwelcome news in many careers, and this can lead to tragedies in labor relations. Even in places known for high cognition, one can find this syndrome, such as in a Texas trial court between two major oil companies. It is likely that the cause of the trial was a general counsel's unwillingness to carry bad news to a strong-minded CEO.\n",
      "\n",
      " CBS suffered from Persian Messenger Syndrome, where Chairman Paley was hostile to people who brought him bad news, leading to bad decisions. The antidote to this is to welcome bad news and be wise and informed so people don't fear telling you bad news. At Berkshire, they have an injunction to tell bad news promptly.\n",
      "\n",
      " The Influence-from-Mere-Association Tendency is a phenomenon in which a person receiving a favor may feel resentment and hostility towards the favor giver due to past pain associated with them. This is illustrated by the story of Glotz, who owned an apartment building and was lenient in collecting rent, only to be met with hostility from a tenant at a public hearing. The tenant revealed that he had been supported in college by Glotz fellowships, demonstrating the Influence-from-Mere-Association Tendency.\n",

      " Simple, Pain-Avoiding Psychological Denial is a phenomenon in which people distort facts to make them more bearable when reality is too painful to accept. This is often seen in cases of love, death, and chemical dependency. While it is understandable to use denial to make dying easier, some people strive to persevere without hope.\n",
      "\n",
      " Chemical dependency is a serious issue that often leads to a breakdown of morals. Freudian remedies have been unsuccessful in reversing addiction, but Alcoholics Anonymous has achieved a 50% success rate by using psychological tendencies to counter addiction. However, the process is difficult and draining, and there is still a 50% failure rate. It is important to avoid any behavior that could lead to chemical dependency, as the damage it can cause is severe.\n",
      "\n",
      " Man tends to overappraise himself and his possessions, a phenomenon known as the \"endowment effect\". This is seen in the way people rate themselves as above average, their spouses, children, and even their possessions. This tendency is seen in all of man's decisions, which are seen as better after they are made.\n",
      "\n",
      " Psychology professors have conducted experiments to demonstrate that people are more likely to return a lost wallet if the owner resembles the finder.

He also discusses six psychological tendencies that are generally useful but can lead to errors, and how cognitive drift, or incentive-caused bias, is present in every profession and can lead to terrible behavior.

The Deprival-Superreaction Tendency causes people to react more strongly to losses than to gains, and can lead to cognitive dysfunction and gambling addiction.\n",

      " This article discusses various psychological tendencies, such as Deprival-Superreaction Tendency, Social-Proof Tendency, Contrast-Misreaction Tendency, and Authority-Misinfluence Tendency, and how they can lead to bad decisions. It also discusses the work of Pavlov and his experiments on stress-induced nervous breakdowns in dogs, as well as the legal implications of using stress as a reversal method. It also discusses the Use-It-or-Lose-It Tendency, Availability-Misweighing Tendency, and Reason-Respecting Tendency, and how they can be used to counteract cognitive biases. Finally, it discusses the Lollapalooza Tendency, which is the tendency to get extreme consequences from confluences of psychological tendencies.\n",

      " This article discusses the utility of elementary psychological knowledge and its potential for refinement. It provides examples of how psychological tendencies can be used to manipulate people, and how they can be used to prevent disaster. It also discusses the moral and prudential implications of using psychological knowledge to manipulate people, and encourages psychology professors to make heavy use of inversion, drive for a complete description of the psychological system, and emphasize effects from combinations of psychological tendencies. Finally, it introduces Farnam Street Media Inc., a company that offers a weekly email full of actionable ideas and insights for work and home.\"\n",

      " Charlie Munger's \"The Psychology of Human Misjudgment\" discusses the implications of various psychological tendencies, such as incentive-caused bias, liking/loving tendency, disliking/hating tendency, doubt-avoidance tendency, and inconsistency-avoidance tendency, and how they can be beneficial or detrimental in different contexts. It also discusses the implications of reciprocated hostility and favor, and suggests that culture can help make up for the lack of help from genes in regulating intraspecies behavior. It encourages psychology professors to make heavy use of inversion, drive for a complete description of the psychological system, and emphasize effects from combinations of psychological tendencies.\n"
