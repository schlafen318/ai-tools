He also emphasizes the “lollapalooza” power of psychological misjudgments in combination.\n",

      "\"Second, because my formal psychological knowledge came only from skimming three psychology textbooks about fifteen years ago, I know virtually nothing about any academic psychology later developed. Yet, in a longer talk containing guesses, I would be criticizing much academic psychology. This sort of intrusion into a professional territory by an amateur would be sure to be resented by professors who would rejoice in finding my errors and might be prompted to respond to my published criticism by providing theirs. Why should I care about new criticism? Well, who likes new hostility from articulate critics with an information advantage?\"\n",

My old Harvard Law classmate, Ed Rothschild, always called such a popping-off “the shoe button complex,” named for the condition of a family friend who spoke in oracular style on all subjects after becoming dominant in the shoe button business.\n",

Otherwise, they wouldn’t be there, working pretty well for man, given his condition and his limited brain capacity. So the tendencies can’t be simply washed out automatically, and shouldn’t be. Nevertheless, the psychological thought system described, when properly understood and used, enables the spread of wisdom and good conduct and facilitates the avoidance of disaster. Tendency is not always destiny, and knowing the tendencies and their antidotes can often help prevent trouble that would otherwise occur.

      " Charlie Munger's \"The Psychology of Human Misjudgment\" is a seminal work on why humans behave the way they do.

This revised edition is now known as \"The Revised Psychology of Human Misjudgment\".\n",
      "\n",
      " In this lecture, Charlie Munger discusses the importance of recognizing patterns which influence people's behavior, both rational and irrational. He provides 25 reasons for human misjudgement to support his argument, and explains the combined or 'lollapalooza' power of psychological misjudgements. A printable PDF is available and the talk has been published with permission of Peter Kaufman and Charlie Munger.\n",

      " In 2005, Charlie revised his psychology talk given 15 years prior, believing he could do better at age 81. Despite prior knowledge from age 70 and hasty notes, Charlie saw four disadvantages in his endeavor.\n",

      " This article discusses the disadvantages of giving a written \"talk\" which would make it more confusing and boring for people than an earlier talk due to the logical completeness of the words and definitions used.

The narrator is also concerned about making a fool of himself.\n",

Additionally, these institutions embraced their ignorance of psychology, exhibiting a Nietzschean pride in not engaging with the \"fuzzy\" psychology and its professors.\n",
      "\n",
      " For many years, Caltech had a psychology professor in its course catalogue whose titles listed him as a \"Professor of Psychoanalytical Studies,\" and he taught classes on \"Abnormal Psychology\" and \"Psychoanalysis in Literature.\" However, this ignorant mindset has only recently been challenged.\n",

      " The author had respect for the power of genetic evolution, understanding the similarities between humans and less cognitively advanced animals driven by their environment. As a result, they knew humanity tended to respect authority, cooperate with their own hierarchy members, and distrust outsiders.\n",
      "\n",
      " In order to make sense of the extreme irrationality he encountered, the narrator searched for a better theoretical structure upon which to base his observations and experiences. He had a deep love for theory and realized that it was beneficial in helping him to achieve his goals.\n",
      "\n",
      " The narrator recalls how learning theory enabled them to excel without effort in school, and decided to build their own system of psychology to help them attain independence and financial freedom faster. They use the determination of the little red hen as their inspiration.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The author used two strategies to pursue their quest: applying the advice to \"invert, always invert\" to gain insight, and collecting examples of bad judgement from outside their professional territory. The author then pondered ways to avoid similar outcomes for their own work.\n",
      "\n",
      " The speaker is hesitant to think about a singular problem without taking into account the connections between them, since all real-world problems are interconnected. They fear they will \"end up with no brain at all\" if they take this approach.\n",

      " \n",
      "The narrator was fascinated by social insects, specifically how honeybees and harvester ants can drastically increase their natural lifespan through just one mating event in the sky. Their evolutionary success can be attributed to extreme cooperation within the breeding colony and aggression towards those outside it, even from the same species.\n",
      "\n",
      " The author was initially guilty of living up to the German folk saying of 'too soon old and too late smart', and avoided psychology textbooks. Fortunately they later realised that most psychology textbooks of the time wouldn't have provided a helpful guide on cults. As the author eventually got to psychology textbooks, they realised they were collecting psychology experiments in the same way a boy collects butterflies.\n",
      "\n",
      " After researching psychology texts, Jacob Viner's observation was remembered - that many academics are trained narrowly and unable to do anything else. Furthermore, hundreds of pages of musings on nature and nurture was unhelpful, as psychology texts failed to address the complexity of intertwined psychological tendencies that interact in life.\n",
      "\n",
      " The authors of elementary texts avoid complex explanations of intertwined effects in order to not repel newcomers to their discipline. This may be caused by their lack of knowledge, and most importantly, they lack an interest in providing a discussion of antidotes to standard psychology-based extravaganza which was of great interest to the author.\n",
      "\n",
      " In the course of general reading, Robert Cialdini, a distinguished psychology professor at Arizona State University, has produced the book Influence, aimed at a popular audience, which explains how human beings can be manipulated by taking advantage of their intrinsic thinking flaws. Cialdini himself has achieved early recognition in his field, being appointed a 'Regents' Professor' at a very young age.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In appreciation of Cialdini's contribution to society, the author gave Cialdini a share of Berksire Stock [Class A] and sent copies of his book to his children. Cialdini's commercial success with a book about social psychology was remarkable given that it didn't promise to improve people's lives in any material way.\n",
      "\n",
      " Cialdini wrote a book to teach people how to become less easily tricked by salesmen, but ironically, it became popular with salesmen who wanted to be more effective in manipulating customers. He warns that this should be remembered when discussing how incentives can lead to bias.\n",
      "\n",
      " Munger created a partial summary of non-patient-treating, non-nature vs. nurture-weighing parts of non-developmental psychology based off of a combination of psychological textbooks, previous training and experience, and Cialdini's book. The material was taken from its original discoverers, often with new titles and descriptions for easier recall, and revised for Munger's easy use as he attempts to avoid errors.\n",

      " The limitations of evolution on nervous-system cells that control behavior are demonstrated by social insects, who generally have fewer than 100,000 cells in their nervous system, compared to the billions of cells humans have in their brain.\n",
      "\n",
      " Ants have a physical structure and behavioral algorithms, which are almost entirely determined by genetics. They do not learn a large amount of behavior and primarily respond to a limited number of stimuli.\n",
      "\n",
      " Harvard's E.O Wilson conducted an experiment in which a live ant was painted with a dead-ant pheromone, causing other ants to remove it from the hive regardless of its protests. This experiment provides evidence of the limited behavior repertoire of ants, responding only to a predetermined set of stimuli, relying on instinct instead of higher thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This refers to an approach of predetermined responses that tends to work, but is often used without any thought or consideration, leading to unintended consequences.\n",
      "\n",
      " Ants can be misled by external influences or manipulation, as their limited brain can sometimes cause them to end up in detrimental situations. Humans may experience the same phenomena due to the simplifications of our mental processes, as our brains attempt to solve more difficult problems than their ant counterparts.\n",
      "\n",
      " This article explains how man's perception system can be easily manipulated. A quantum effect in perception means that if stimulus remain below a certain threshold, it will not be perceived. This was demonstrated when a magician was able to make the Statue of Liberty disappear with just the use of magician lingo in the dark.\n",
      "\n",
      " The audience sat on a rotating platform, not able to feel the movement due to its slow acceleration. When a curtain was opened, it appeared as if the Statue had disappeared. The perception of this event to the audience was weighted by the shocking contrast of the disappearance rather than the scientific measurements behind it.\n",
      "\n",
      " A magician is able to remove a person's wristwatch without being detected, by creating a high contrast of another intense pressure of touch elsewhere on the body thus \"swamping\" the pressure on the wrist and rendering it imperceptible.\n",
      "\n",
      " Psychology professors often use an experiment to demonstrate how perception can be easily misguided by contrast: having students place one hand in hot water and the other in cold water, then both hands are placed in a single bucket of lukewarm water. Despite the water temperature being the same, their perception is altered to make one hand feel cold water and the other hand feel hot water. This serves to demonstrate that cognition and perception can be fooled by simple contrast and makes the participant realize how they can be misled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "By understanding how magicians trick us, we can learn to protect ourselves from being fooled by life, whether deliberately by human manipulation or otherwise, by being aware of misguiding tendencies of our own perception and cognition.\n",
      "\n",
      " Humans possess numerous psychological tendencies which often lead to wrong conclusions, but are in general useful. This profusion of tendencies leads to the principle of social psychology that the same person can make different conclusions based on the situation they are in.\n",
      "\n",
      " This article introduces the principles of social psychology and discusses nine psychology-based tendencies that people commonly find useful, but might lead to errors. These tendencies include a Superresponse to reward and punishment, Liking/Loving and Disliking/Hating, Doubt-Avoidance, Inconsistency-Avoidance, Curiosity, Kantian Fairness, Envy/Jealousy, and Reciprocation Tendencies. Discussion of errors from each tendency and antidotes to these errors will follow.\n",

      " \"Granny's Rule\" is a powerful reward system in which you motivate yourself to first complete necessary but unpleasant tasks before being rewarded. This rule is so effective that it is often used by consultant Ph. D. psychologists in business organizations. The rule requires that \"children eat their carrots before they get dessert\" while the business version requires executives to complete their unpleasant daily tasks before rewarding themselves.\n",

      " This article questions why psychology professors of a former era adopted an overly-narrow approach to their own subject, as if physicists neglecting astrophysics and compound effects. It investigates six tendences which interact with and affect one another and discusses the suggested “lollapalooza tendency”, which can have a significant impact on decision-making. The article then looks at how practical applications of these tendencies have been seen in fields like medicine, business, and aviation, as well as our reactions to authority and paradoxes in math and psychology. Finally, it proposes if more reconciliation of psychology and economics is required for a successful outcome.\n",

       "\"\\nThis article examines the implications of several psychological tendencies when combined, and how it can lead to disastrous outcomes. It discusses examples from Federal Express and Xerox, as well as Professor Skinner's studies with rats and pigeons, to explain how incentives and rewards can be used effectively to increase productivity. It also explores the effects of money, rewards, and punishments on human behavior and decision-making, and suggests solutions such as cash registers, sound accounting, and understanding psychological reality. Finally, it discusses the interactions between scientific fields such as psychology and economics, and how accuracy and reconciliation are required for success.\""
